Thus, the aim of the paper is to present and assess the place of various areas of silver economy activity in the development policy of Polish rural areas to which the descriptive statistics method was applied. The analysis performed shows that currently in Poland progress has been achieved in operationalisation of activities in the area of silver economy at quite a general level - programmes addressed to seniors as the overall community are created. On the other hand, roadmaps are missing for the implementation of senior policy for specific segments of elderly populations inhabiting rural areas where unfavourable demographic situation is particularly visible and where the society ageing process proceeds at a much slower space than across the country.","[Krzyminiewska, Grazyna; Pondel, Hanna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Krzyminiewska, G (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",grazyna.krzyminiewska@ue.poznan.pl; hanna.pondel@ue.poznan.pl,"Pondel, Hanna/JLM-7903-2023; Krzyminiewska, Grazyna/IQV-4512-2023","Pondel, Hanna/0000-0002-0107-5552; Krzyminiewska, Grazyna/0000-0002-1573-3771",,,,,15,0,0,2,18,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-735-0,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2019,9,,1,,,,487,498,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3CN,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000461883000049,View Full Record in Web of Science

The commercial dynamism of China during the 16th-19th centuries was integrally related to the importation of foreign silver, initially from Japan but principally from Latin America. Yet the significance of imports of Latin American silver for the Chinese economy changed substantially over these three centuries in tandem with the rhythms of China's domestic economy as well as the global trading system.

It was conducted on the basis of data from the Eurostat database. This study used multivariate statistical analysis methods: k-means, COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) in a dynamic approach, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and hierarchical clustering. EU countries differ in terms of the studied aspects of the silver economy in a north-south direction. In the period under study, there were significant changes in the country rankings and these changes were not the same for the EU countries. Also, most EU countries indicated improvements in terms of analyzed aspects of the silver economy. An innovative approach is the use of the COPRAS method in a dynamic approach, thanks to which it is possible to develop not only country rankings, but also to analyze the dynamics of changes.","[Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata; Dmytrow, Krzysztof] Univ Szczecin, Inst Econ & Finance, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Frackiewicz, Ewa] Univ Szczecin, Inst Management, PL-71004 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin; University of Szczecin,"Bieszk-Stolorz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Inst Econ & Finance, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",beata.bieszk-stolorz@usz.edu.pl; krzysztof.dmytrow@usz.edu.pl; ewa.frackiewicz@usz.edu.pl,"Dmytrow, Krzysztof/H-4659-2017; Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata/AAO-3226-2020","Dmytrow, Krzysztof/0000-0001-7657-6063; Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata/0000-0001-8086-9037",,,,,83,0,0,54,54,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2024,16,23,,,,,,,10703,10.3390/su162310703,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su162310703,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,P4S0N,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001377813400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the next section of the paper, the action opportunities for the longevity saving strategy in Brazil are exposed with summaries of some key sectors, according to the international literature on the silver economy. The income of the older people and the purchasing power of families with older adults are analysed in the following sections. In the conclusion, some recommended actions for building the silver economy strategy in Brazil is discussed.

While ICT offers a wide array of solutions for meeting the needs of the silver generation, such as healthcare, independent living, accommodation, e-governance, assistive technologies etc., many other factors also come into play following the practical manifestations of technological development. After introducing the concept of demographic change and silver economy, this paper explores the effects of ICT solutions on the silver generation in terms of their ethical and moral ramifications. These pertain to concepts like informed consent, over-reliance on technology, social isolation and loneliness, lack of real human interaction, a decline in the quality of cross-generational communication, privacy, cybersecurity and affordability of ICT innovations. The discussion conducted in the paper emerged in the OSIRIS project - an initiative to respond to the challenges of the growing ageing populations through smart specialization approaches and technological innovation in the Baltic states.","[Butt, Sidra Azmat; Draheim, Dirk] Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Butt, SA (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, Tallinn, Estonia.",sidra.butt@taltech.ee; dirk.draheim@taltech.ee,,"Butt, Sidra Azmat/0000-0003-1503-8901",,,,,11,5,5,9,26,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2573-2005,2573-1998,978-1-6654-2513-1,INT CONF EDEMOC EGOV,,,2021,,,,,,,152,155,,10.1109/ICEDEG52154.2021.9530895,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEDEG52154.2021.9530895,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Communication; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Political Science; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Communication; Government & Law; Public Administration,BT7BJ,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000847020200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study covered all 36 municipalities that compose the Polish National Cittaslow Network. The following research methods were employed: a critical review of the literature, analysis of secondary data, including strategic development planning documents, and quantitative methods, including a method of grouping objects on the basis of a synthetic variable. The study has demonstrated that nearly all Cittaslow municipalities experienced a decrease in population during the analyzed period, which coincided with a growing share of the non-working-age population. This attests to the ongoing process of population aging. A significant challenge that the analyzed municipalities faced was determined to be the growing demographic burden. Based on a synthetic indicator of the potential for silver economy development, the municipalities were divided into five classes: very high, high, medium, low, and very low potential. Interestingly, most of the municipalities are now distinguished as having medium, low, or very low potential for the development of the silver economy. The analysis presented in this article contributes to further research on factors and tools shaping a development policy that may influence the development of the silver economy in the Cittaslow municipalities of Poland and the world.","[Wierzbicka, Wioletta; Farelnik, Eliza] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ Sci, M Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Farelnik, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ Sci, M Oczapowskiego 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",wioletta.wierzbicka@uwm.edu.pl; eliza.farelnik@uwm.edu.pl,"Wierzbicka, Wioletta/N-8334-2019","Wierzbicka, Wioletta/0000-0001-6499-8242",University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland); Faculty of Economic Sciences,University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland); Faculty of Economic Sciences,The research was funded by the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland) under a grant from the Faculty of Economic Sciences.,,66,1,1,56,65,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2024,16,16,,,,,,,6768,10.3390/su16166768,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16166768,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,F1O0M,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001307568600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With its broad consumer base, long industrial chain, and variety of needs, the silver economy will provide the digital healthcare sector with a lot of prospects and enhance the well-being of the elderly while also promoting the sustainable development of the socio-economic environment. Research on digital healthcare services for the elderly is gaining traction in the digital economy era, although thorough studies in this area are still very uncommon. Therefore, in order to investigate potential future trends in digital healthcare services from the perspective of the silver economy, this research uses the visualization tool CiteSpace6.3.R1 to perform descriptive statistics, clustering analysis, and co-occurrence analysis on 639 relevant papers. The findings indicate that although China's research in this field began later than that of other nations, it offers distinct benefits and enormous potential. Due to the irreversibility of population aging, digital health management in the context of the silver economy is likely to become a focal point of future digital society research. Innovation in the field of digital healthcare is being driven by the proper integration of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence and big data. In conclusion, this paper develops a research paradigm for the administration of digital healthcare services from the standpoint of the silver economy. This study offers cutting-edge insights and theoretical references, giving academics insightful advice on current research trends and possible future approaches.","[Zeng, Yangyan; Fu, Jiaojuan; Cao, Wenzhi; Chen, Yang] Hunan Univ Technol & Business, Sch Frontier Crossover Studies, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yangyan; Cao, Wenzhi; Chen, Yang] Xiangjiang Lab, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhihui] Hunan Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Technol & Management, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China",Hunan University of Technology & Business; Hunan University of Finance & Economics,"Cao, WZ (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ Technol & Business, Sch Frontier Crossover Studies, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China.;Cao, WZ (通讯作者)，Xiangjiang Lab, Changsha 410205, Peoples R China.",zyy@hutb.edu.cn; fujiao0229@163.com; wenzcao@hutb.edu.cn; chenyang@hutb.edu.cn; yangzhihui33@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Hunan Province Education Department General Project for Teaching Reform in Colleges and Universities [HNJG-20230794]; Major Project of Xiangjiang Laboratory in China [23XJ01008]; Interdisciplinary Research Project at Hunan University of Technology and Business, China [2023SZJ01]; [72274058]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hunan Province Education Department General Project for Teaching Reform in Colleges and Universities; Major Project of Xiangjiang Laboratory in China; Interdisciplinary Research Project at Hunan University of Technology and Business, China;","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 72274058), the Hunan Province Education Department General Project for Teaching Reform in Colleges and Universities (Grant no.

Nowhere was the human cost of that commercial network higher, however, than at the Huancavelica mercury mines, where the colonial government forced indigenous workers to toil in conditions so poisonous and dangerous that some officials referred to the site as the mine of death and a public slaughterhouse. Officials justified the coercion on the grounds that because refiners used mercury to process their silver ores through amalgamation and that the empire and its economy depended on American silver. By 1650 improved ventilation in the Huancavelica mines and better refining techniques had lowered the workers' death rates, but labour there still may have killed as many as a third of the male population.

Background Older people constitute a growing sector of the population of developed countries and there is increasing interest in the concept of the Silver Economy which is the contribution older people can and do make to the general economies of their communities and countries. Sources of evidence We obtained a range of relevant documents from international organisations and related academic literature. Discussion There is a range of interrelated health promotion aspects of ageing related to physical health, mental health and cognitive health. Promoting activities related to these could have both direct and indirect impact on the economy in addition to improving the health and well-being of older people. Conclusions Nurses have a responsibility to understand the health promotion related aspects of ageing and the contribution they can make to improving the health and well-being of older people. Nurses could, specifically, promote activities amongst older people that will have an impact on health and on the economy. Implications for nursing Nurses need to integrate more health promotion related aspects of ageing into their practice and to be able to evaluate the health-related improvements they make and also to evaluate and indicate the contribution this makes to the health of older people and to the economy.","[Watson, Roger] Southwest Med Univ, 319,Section 3,Zhongshan Rd, Luzhou 646099, Peoples R China; [Hayter, Mark] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Fac Hlth Psychol & Social Care, Head Nursing, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Zanini, Milko] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci, Sci English, Genoa, Italy; [Aleo, Giuseppe; Catania, Gianluca] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Sasso, Loredana; Bagnasco, Annamaria] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci, Nursing, Genoa, Italy",Southwest Medical University; Manchester Metropolitan University; University of Genoa; University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Watson, R (通讯作者)，Southwest Med Univ, 319,Section 3,Zhongshan Rd, Luzhou 646099, Peoples R China.",rwatson1955@gmail.com,"Bagnasco, Annamaria/AAF-6784-2021; Hayter, mark/HLQ-6837-2023; Zanini, Milko/L-8293-2015; Watson, Roger/A-2969-2009; SASSO, LOREDANA/K-1504-2016; ALEO, GIUSEPPE/C-3848-2016; CATANIA, GIANLUCA/C-5845-2016; Bagnasco, Annamaria/J-9834-2016","Zanini, Milko/0000-0002-1081-6279; Watson, Roger/0000-0001-8040-7625; SASSO, LOREDANA/0000-0001-5886-5937; ALEO, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-1306-3364; CATANIA, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-0862-071X; Bagnasco, Annamaria/0000-0002-9079-8460",,,,,18,2,2,25,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-8132,1466-7657,,INT NURS REV,Int.

The general macroeconomic goals of any country are economic growth and sustainable development. In Europe and Latvia, these goals would be achieved by implementing an effective silver policy and economy. The authors have concluded that not cutting the value of human capital and finding opportunities to increase its productivity are the most important long-term challenges. The aim of research is identification of factors that affect the possibilities for developing high-quality human capital in a silver society. As a result, the authors have offered recommendations to be implemented in order, despite the negative changes to the demographic situation, the value of human capital will not be reduced, its productivity will be increased by implementing the silver economy.","[Zencaka, Andra; Senfelde, Maija; Pavlova, Inesa] Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Zencaka, A (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",Andra_z@inbox.lv; Maija.Senfelde@rtu.lv; Inesa.Pavlova@rtu.lv,,,,,,,9,1,1,5,21,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-321-4,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2019,51,,,,,,260,266,,10.22616/ESRD.2019.084,http://dx.doi.org/10.22616/ESRD.2019.084,,,7,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BO7ZU,,Bronze,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000526396700033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our research is based on an empirical study of the French silver economy, which consists in an enquiry carried out in Silver Valley. The results of our study lead us to suggest a new term 'geront'innovation' to qualify the various forms of innovations developed to cater for the needs of elderly people. We also put forward the importance of networking and open innovation strategies. Finally, the identified barriers to emergence and diffusion as perceived by the supply side of the market lead us to suggest recommendations to support the diffusion of geront'innovations.","[Laperche, Blandine; Boutillier, Sophie; Liu, Zeting] Univ Littoral Cote dOpale, CLERSE UMR CNRS 8019, 21 Quai Citadelle, F-59140 Dunkerque, France; [Djellal, Faridah] Univ Lille, CLERSE UMR CNRS8019, Lille, France; [Ingham, Marc; Reboud, Sophie] Burgundy Business Sch, Dijon, France; [Picard, Fabienne] Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, IRTES RECITS, Belfort, France; [Tanguy, Corinne] INRA AgroSup Dijon, CESAER, AGROSUP Dijon, Dijon, France; [Laperche, Blandine; Boutillier, Sophie; Djellal, Faridah; Ingham, Marc; Liu, Zeting; Picard, Fabienne; Reboud, Sophie; Tanguy, Corinne; Uzunidis, Dimitri] Res Network Innovat, Paris, France",Universite du Littoral-Cote-d'Opale; Universite de Lille; Universite Bourgogne Europe; Burgundy School of Business; Universite de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM); Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; INRAE,"Laperche, B (通讯作者)，Univ Littoral Cote dOpale, CLERSE UMR CNRS 8019, 21 Quai Citadelle, F-59140 Dunkerque, France.",blandine.laperche@univ-littoral.fr,"Djellal, Faridah/HKV-8875-2023","Corinne, Tanguy/0000-0001-5606-1214; djellal, Faridah/0000-0003-4187-2473; Reboud, Sophie/0000-0003-2867-1378","French Chaire Transitions demographiques/Transitions economiques; Fondation du Risque, Paris; Research Network on Innovation","French Chaire Transitions demographiques/Transitions economiques; Fondation du Risque, Paris; Research Network on Innovation","This research is supported by the French Chaire Transitions demographiques/Transitions economiques, Fondation du Risque, Paris and the Research Network on Innovation.",,58,15,16,21,101,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7325,1465-3990,,TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG,Technol.

In this paper, an initial set of requirements is identified and, based on that, a consolidated concept of the platform is elaborated. In service of this, a total of 22 interviews have been conducted and analyzed using tool-based thematic analysis. Interviews were taken from the quadruple helix actors already involved in the project to help set a general scope and direction of the platform. Based on the results, the initial functionalities were identified which were then validated with the project partners and, therefore, led to groundwork to generate a plausible vision and mission statement for the platform.","[Butt, Sidra Azmat; Rava, Karin; Kangilaski, Taivo; Pappel, Ingrid; Draheim, Dirk] Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Butt, SA (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Informat Syst Grp, Tallinn, Estonia.",sidra.butt@taltech.ee; karin.rava@taltech.ee; taivo.kangilaski@taltech.ee; ingrid.pappel@taltech.ee; dirk.draheim@taltech.ee,,"Butt, Sidra Azmat/0000-0003-1503-8901; Pappel, Ingrid/0000-0002-5148-9841",,,,,24,4,4,2,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2573-2005,2573-1998,978-1-6654-2513-1,INT CONF EDEMOC EGOV,,,2021,,,,,,,47,54,,10.1109/ICEDEG52154.2021.9530937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEDEG52154.2021.9530937,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Communication; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Political Science; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Communication; Government & Law; Public Administration,BT7BJ,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000847020200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

What the European Silver Economy teaches us about the co-constitution of ageing and innovation,AGEING & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ageing and innovation; European policy; Silver Economy; Active and Healthy Ageing; progressive politics; co-constitution,OLD; AGE,"Ageing has become a ubiquitous concern in European policy. Critics have bemoaned that such policies are not so much about older people but rather about finding justification for other policy aims, such as economic growth or technological innovation. However, such critiques do not capture the co-constitutive relationship between ageing and innovation shaping one another. Using the example of the Silver Economy discourse, we show that ageing has not only been reframed under the imperatives of economic and innovation policies, but that ageing itself can also affect those policies. In its formative stages, the Silver Economy was characterised by a number of tensions between, on the one hand, common ageist assumptions about old age and, on the other hand, alternative visions of what ageing could mean as a policy field. However, these potentials have later been domesticated within the broader field of Active and Healthy Ageing. In this Forum Article, we therefore hypothesise what it would mean to take ageing more seriously as a driver of progressive politics as indicated in those formative years of the Silver Economy. Such a speculative take on current old-age policy, we hold, opens up a number of fruitful avenues and new interfaces between critical researchers, practitioners and policy makers interested in driving progressive politics.","[Lipp, Benjamin] Univ Hamburg, Sci Studies & Innovat Res, Hamburg, Germany; [Peine, Alexander] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Hamburg; Utrecht University,"Lipp, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Sci Studies & Innovat Res, Hamburg, Germany.",benjamin.lipp@uni-hamburg.de,"Peine, Alexander/N-4327-2013; Lipp, Benjamin/KHU-9564-2024",,,,,,46,7,7,24,60,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0144-686X,1469-1779,,AGEING SOC,Ageing Soc.,JUL,2024,44,7,,,,,1481,1493,PII S0144686X22000903,10.1017/S0144686X22000903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X22000903,,SEP 2022,13,Gerontology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,H6P8M,,hybrid,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000849968400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this line, the role and weight of older adults turns more important due to the modifications such transformation will bring about in their characteristics, needs, expectations and goals as regards their personal, economic, political, technological and social aspects. This situation has given rise to the concept of Silver Economy, which broadly speaking represents that part of the economy related to the demographic change caused by aging population, including all those economic activities, products and services intended to meet the needs of older adults. Its being a growing field of knowledge makes it complex to identify the driving forces and agents that boost its development and therefore to promote and consolidate this new concept. In accordance with this opportunity, this piece of research maps the main research themes available in literature, making use of SciMAT-based smart bibliometric tools and techniques. In addition to other actions, this research makes it possible to identify the main themes, who the relevant agents are, the pioneering countries in this field, and the more productive organizations and sources.

These reveal that silver bullion of Scandinavian origin was used as currency throughout the Danelaw between AD 865 and 940. Standardised weights of copper alloy were an integral part of this metal-weight economy. Bullion was not the sole means of silver payment during this period: coinage had long been used in the occupied Anglo-Saxon territories and continued to be minted under the Vikings. The resulting dual-currency economy may have facilitated trade with neighbouring Scandinavian territories, but the two currencies also served as markers of cultural identity, offering a choice of monetary media.","[Kershaw, Jane] UCL, Inst Archaeol, 31-34 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PY, England",University of London; University College London,"Kershaw, J (通讯作者)，UCL, Inst Archaeol, 31-34 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PY, England.",j.kershaw@ucl.ac.uk,"Kershaw, Jane/Q-1184-2017","Kershaw, Jane/0000-0002-2237-6186",British Academy,British Academy(British Academy),"This research was conducted during a British Academy post-doctoral research fellowship.

Followed by leaching optimization, silver was selectively recovered through precipitation. The precipitated silver chloride was valorized though silver nanoparticle synthesis by a simple one-pot greener synthesis route. Through leaching-precipitation optimization, quantitative selective recovery of silver chloride was achieved, followed by homogeneous pure silver nanoparticle about 100 nm size were synthesized. The reported recycling process is a simple process, versatile, easy to implement, requires minimum facilities and no specialty chemicals, through which semiconductor manufacturing industry can treat the waste generated during manufacturing of LTCC and reutilize the valorized silver nanoparticles in manufacturing in a close loop process. Our reported process can address issues like; (i) waste disposal, as well as value-added silver recovery, (ii) brings back the material to production stream and.address the circular economy, and (iii) can be part of lower the futuristic carbon economy and cradle-to-cradle technology management, simultaneously.

The flow of silver bullion from Western Europe to Asian markets and especially China, was the 'sustained breadth' or the macroeconomic condition that mining needed to trigger bundles of money relations at the local and regional levels in dialectical response to such condition. The paper presents a general discussion of two exemplary cases of silver mining monopolies that confirm this argument. In the first case, a local mining corporation in Trent unleashed money relations that expanded both monopoly power over the mines of the city along with monetary relations. The second case, the colonial mining monopolies of Spanish America, shows how money and debt relations increased the speed of mining along with Western European bullion demand in this period. The paper argues that the relation between mining monopolies and money in world history perspective is an urgent line of inquiry to historians and social scientists interested in understanding the centuries-old, dynamic nexus between mining and capital.","[Graulau, Jeannette] CUNY, Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd West, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Graulau, J (通讯作者)，CUNY, Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 250 Bedford Pk Blvd West, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",jeannette.graulau@lehman.cuny.edu,,"Graulau, Jeannette/0000-0003-2478-5466",,,,,100,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",2214-790X,2214-7918,,EXTRACT IND SOC,Extr.

This change is determined by demographic factors, the main of which should include a significant increase in the retirement age population. The study of problems and prospects for the development of the silver economy is one of the most important scientific tasks of our time. The purpose of research was to identify psychological reasons for involving older age cohorts in the labor market. The hypothesis of the study considered the silver generation as the potential of the modern economy. The main characteristics of social activity in the workplace are the value orientations of the older age cohort. The study involved 452 employees of enterprises in the Southern Urals: 256 of them (57%) aged 46-54 years; 177 people (39%) aged 55-62 years and 19 people over the age of 62 years (4%). The study evaluated two indicators: the system of value orientations and social activity in these age groups. Social activity was estimated by the experts (the line managers of the divisions). A questionnaire on the value and attractiveness of work was chosen to study value orientations. The results showed connection between indicators of social activity and values: creative, interesting work (1% level of significance); active life position (5% level of significance); responsibility development (5% level of significance). The largest number of connections are formed by value orientations among themselves in the age group of 5562 years - 8 connections. The number of connections in the structure of values allows us to determine the leading role of value orientations in the formation of life position at the age of 55-62 years. The results of the study reveal the positive aspects of the involvement of older generations in labor activity. Turning to the silver economy is associated with the use of the undisclosed potential of the older generation, which will not only reduce the demographic risks of loss of productivity, but even benefit from the qualities associated with the characteristics of the silver generation.","[Desfonteines, L.

The OSIRIS Interreg Baltic Sea initiative is a response to this aging challenge and is composed of quadruple helix stakeholders in Denmark, Finland, and the Baltic states. An ICT-based outcome of the project was Silver-Hub.eu, a collective intelligence digital platform that provides users with Silver Economy market reports, partner contact search, and innovation-supporting digital tools. However, it does not contain cross-border data exchange or e-service provision capability, which requires digital interoperability architecture and transitioning to becoming a more digitally mature platform. The Digital Europe Programme's cross-border data exchange building block, eDelivery, was identified as a potential integration solution to improve Silver-Hub's platform maturity level. This study is an initial qualitative investigation of the interoperability dynamics and requirements for the SilverHub ecosystem to integrate with eDelivery. Document analysis and several workshops with SilverHub stakeholders were conducted. Based on these results, an eDelivery organizational-specific model was deemed most appropriate for the SilverHub ecosystem, along with a dynamic discovery model for cross-border data exchange. Future work includes a feasibility analysis of eDelivery integration and simulating eDelivery data exchange between SilverHub and its organizational members.","[Jackson, Eric B.; Pappel, Ingrid; Ben Yahia, Sadok] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Kivimaki, Petteri] Nord Inst Interoperable Solut, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Jackson, EB (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",eric.jackson@taltech.ee; petteri.kivimaki@niis.org; ingrid.pappel@taltech.ee; sadok.ben@taltech.ee,"BEN YAHIA, sadok/C-8239-2019","BEN YAHIA, sadok/0000-0001-8939-8948; Pappel, Ingrid/0000-0002-5148-9841",,,,,28,0,0,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,979-8-4007-0837-4,,,,2023,,,,,,,172,179,,10.1145/3598469.3598488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3598469.3598488,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Public Administration; Social Issues",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Public Administration; Social Issues,BV5HB,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001048270700019,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find evidence to support a more favourable view of both the mining sector and the imperial state than that commonly presented in the literature.

Mining history says otherwise. Evidence confirms that mining labour enjoyed the conditions for an early emancipation from serfdom, rooted in the ascent of a European silver-based monetary economy from the eleventh century onwards. Feudal lords were caught between Scylla and Charybdis, vulnerable to the rise of free miners and a mining economy that demanded capital outlays. Drawing upon the case study of mining in the feudal principality of Trent, the article briefly sketches the rise of capitalist miners and the conditions that gave them decisive advantages over feudal lords. The article summarizes general arguments and lines of inquiry for opening the field of Marxist agrarian history to the study of mining and extractive economies.","[Graulau, Jeannette] CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, CA-358, New York, NY 10458 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Graulau, J (通讯作者)，CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, CA-358, New York, NY 10458 USA.",jeannette.graulau@lehman.cuny.edu,,"Graulau, Jeannette/0000-0003-2478-5466",,,,,145,2,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The paper presents a new approach for recovering silver from zinc-containing solutions mimicking hydrometallurgical base metal process solution. By nature, silver present in ores or concentrates is more noble than zinc and not effectively leached into the sulfate media during zinc hydrometallurgical processing. This paper presents a novel approach for concentrating and recovering silver present in minor amounts in zinc sulfate media. The electrodepositionredox replacement (EDRR) method was investigated in synthetic zinc sulfate solutions ([Zn] = 60 g/L, [Ag] = 1 ppb250 ppm, [H2SO4] = 10 g/L) containing silver as low as 1 ppb. The deposited metal coating was analyzed by electrochemical techniques and SEM-EDS. As a result, an enrichment of silver as nano- and microparticles on electrodes was evident. With the application of multiple EDRR steps (n = 160), the method was shown to result in a high purity Ag layer (Ag/Zn ratio approximate to 1500 in the product) from solution with minor Ag content (Ag/Zn ratio approximate to 0.0017 in solution). Moreover, at the concentration levels studied, the EDRR method was shown to outperform conventional electrowinning (EW).","[Halli, Petteri; Elomaa, Heini; Wilson, Benjamin P.; Yliniemi, Kirsi; Lundstrom, Mari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Res Grp Hydromet & Corros, Vuorimiehentie 2,POB 16200, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Yliniemi, Kirsi] Aalto Univ, Dept Chem & Mat Sci, Sch Chem Engn, Kemistintie 1,POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Lundström, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Res Grp Hydromet & Corros, Vuorimiehentie 2,POB 16200, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",mari.lundstrom@aalto.fi,"Lundström, Mari/L-6106-2015; Wilson, Benjamin/A-4974-2010; Yliniemi, Kirsi/I-7897-2012","Wilson, Benjamin/0000-0002-2874-6475; Yliniemi, Kirsi/0000-0003-2536-388X; Elomaa, Heini/0000-0002-9032-3553; Halli, Petteri/0000-0002-1803-7632",Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers (METSEK-project); No WASTE project [297962]; Academy of Finland,Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers (METSEK-project); No WASTE project; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),This work has been financed by the Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers (METSEK-project) and No WASTE project (Grant 297962) funded by Academy of Finland.

This demographic trend has created a major economic opportunity known as the silver economy. Technology plays an important role in the development of products and services targeting this older market segment, yet technological innovation has compromised these individuals' quality of life by aggravating already existing social disparities. Limited access to and use of technology is known as digital inequality, which is a matter of growing concern that is pushing experts to develop initiatives that mitigate the impact of this disparity. However, decision makers first need to be fully aware of the challenges associated with this endeavor, which arise out of the inherent complexity of digital inequality and the uncertainty produced by technological disruptions. This study addresses this decision problem by adopting a constructivist, socio-technical approach that combines cognitive mapping and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory techniques in a neutrosophic context. Data were collected from an expert panel with experience in real-world cases. The members analyzed different strategies and their effectiveness in terms of reducing digital inequalities in the silver economy. The results were analyzed and validated by the Head of Data and Analytics at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Data Europe and Latin America. No prior research was found that has used the same combination of operational research methods to address this decision problem. The findings include recommendations for how to facilitate the development of initiatives that increase digital literacy in a silver economy context.","[Jose, Mario L.

The results show that Marshall's analysis offers an empirically sound interpretation of changes in the price level in China and the silver flow across China's borders. The results also confirm that there was a high degree of international integration for China's internal and external prices of silver. Moreover, the stable purchasing power parity could in practice be maintained by silver flow without resorting to a substantial percentage of tradable goods.","[Zhao, Liuyan; Zhao, Yan] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Zhao, LY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhly@pku.edu.cn,"Zhao, Yanfeng/GQQ-8053-2022",,National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA133]; Philosophical and Social Science Foundation of Beijing [13JDJGB039],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Philosophical and Social Science Foundation of Beijing,"Research for this article was financially supported by the the National Social Science Foundation of China (16ZDA133) and the Philosophical and Social Science Foundation of Beijing (13JDJGB039).

Our findings for the short sample period show that the gold-to-silver price ratio resembles the gold-to-platinum price ratios in that it is a useful proxy for global risk. Our findings for the long sample period show, despite some heterogeneity across economies, that the gold-to-silver price ratio often helps to out-of-sample forecast for both 1% and 5% stock market tail risks, particularly when a forecaster suffers a higher loss from underestimation of tail risks than from a corresponding overestimation of the same absolute size. We also find that using the gold-to-silver price ratio for forecasting the total connectedness of stock markets is beneficial for an investor who suffers a higher loss from an underestimation of total connectedness (i.e., an investor who otherwise would overestimate the benefits from portfolio diversification) than from a comparable overestimation.","[Salisu, Afees A.] Ctr Econometr & Appl Res CEAR, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Salisu, Afees A.; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85, POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany; [Gabauer, David] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Data Anal Syst, Hagenberg, Austria",University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University; Softwarepark Hagenberg,"Salisu, AA (通讯作者)，Ctr Econometr & Appl Res CEAR, Ibadan, Nigeria.",adebare1@yahoo.com; macroeconmoics@hsu-hh.de; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; david.gabauer@hotmail.com,"Gabauer, David/MEO-7469-2025; Gupta, Rangan/ACM-0361-2022; salisu, afees/N-1304-2018","Gabauer, David/0000-0003-2465-5741",BMK; BMDW,BMK; BMDW,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for many helpful comments.

Followed by metal leaching, the silver was selectively precipitated using HCl as AgCl. The precipitated AgCl was dissolved in ammonium hydroxide and reduced to pure silver metal nanopowder (NPs) using hydrazine as a reductant. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) used as a stabilizer and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) used as reducing reagent as well as stabilizing reagent to control size and shape of the Ag NPs. An in-depth investigation indicated a first-order kinetics model fits well with high accuracy among all possible models. Activation energy required for the first order reaction was 21.242 kJ mol(-1) for Silver. PVP and PEG 1% each together provide better size control over silver nanoparticle synthesis using 0.4 M hydrazine as reductant, which provides relatively regular morphology in comparison to their individual application. The investigation revealed that the waste LTCC (an industrial e-waste) can be recycled through the reported process even in industrial scale. The novelty of reported recycling process is simplicity, versatile and eco-efficiency through which waste LTCC recycling can address various issues like; (i) industrial waste disposal (ii) synthesis, of silver nanoparticles from waste LTCC (iii) circulate metal economy within a closed loop cycle in the industrial economies where resources are scarce, altogether.

The growing requirements are also important as to attractiveness and diversity, as well as the degree of professionalism of offers for seniors and their growing awareness in this regard.

Silver tourist is a segment with a distinct diversity of needs, and people in this age group are demanding a variety of products and services. Zsarnoczky writes (2016, p. 556) As a result of the growing demand, senior tourists are foreseen to become a powerful consumer group in the near future. Especially in Europe, where silver tourism will develop most dynamically. The objective of the presented article is to indicate that the silver tourist assumptions are currently extremely important from the point of view of the issue of ageing Polish population. To this end, the needs of people from the oldest age groups as to the ways of spending free time will be diagnosed. In addition, it is important to point out that a good recognition and understanding of the needs of seniors is very important for people involved in the creation of tourist offers. It is also crucial for the elderly that their requirements help to co-create the tourist offer.","[Kowalska, Magdalena] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Fac Agr & Econ, Dept Social Policy & Agr Extens, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31462 Krakow, Poland",University of Agriculture in Krakow,"Kowalska, M (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Econ & Social Sci, Fac Agr & Econ, Dept Social Policy & Agr Extens, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31462 Krakow, Poland.",m.kowalska@ur.krakow.p,,"Kowalska, Magdalena/0000-0002-2859-7676",,,,,6,0,0,0,9,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6311,2336-632X,978-80-7509-659-3; 978-80-7509-660-9,PUB RECREAT LANDSC,,,2019,,,,,,,352,355,,,,,,4,"Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Forestry; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN6AA,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000484833100074,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, all arguments in the debate rely on the assertion that the ASPA caused severe deflation-a claim with weak support in the data. In this paper, we investigate the bigger picture by using a newly consolidated historical Chinese dataset covering 1890-1935 to investigate the long-run relationship of silver outflows, international trade, and fiduciary money. We find a mitigation effect of terms of trade after a decrease in the silver price triggered silver outflows from 1890 to 1934. More importantly, we find that the issue of fiduciary money was responsive to silver outflows such that China's aggregate money supply was not severely affected by the outflows. As a result, we clarify the puzzle of why China encountered neither serious deflation nor an economic crisis when the ASPA occurred.","[Chen, Bo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Dan] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yiqing] Shanghai Acad Social Sci, Inst China Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Fudan University; Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences,"Li, D (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Xie, YQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Acad Social Sci, Inst China Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",danli_soe@fudan.edu.cn; yiqingxie@gmail.com,"Li, Dan/J-7581-2016","Xie, Yiqing/0000-0002-4658-4991",National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences [17BJL094],National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 17BJL094",,41,0,0,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

However, kob are exploited both by recreational anglers and by commercial vessels, and it is important to examine the economics of these fisheries in order to determine where catch restrictions will do the least harm to the economy. Data from a survey of commercial fishing vessels are compared with results from earlier surveys of recreational anglers to determine economic values and impacts from both fisheries. The economic benefits are shown to be greatest in recreational angling, less in commercial fishing by large vessels and least in commercial skiboat fishing. This study also shows that catch restrictions would do less harm to the economy if applied to the commercial linefishing sector rather than to recreational angling.","Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; Minist Fisheries & Marine Resources, Swakopmund, Namibia",Umea University,"Umea Univ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",jesperstage@econ.umu.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",,,,,25,13,14,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1814-232X,1814-2338,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

We develop a general equilibrium model of the global economy with gold and silver money. Calibration of the model shows that silver ceased functioning as a global price anchor in the mid-1890s-the price of silver is positively correlated with agricultural commodities through the mid-1890s, but not thereafter. In contrast to Fisher (1911) and Friedman (1990), both of whom predict greater price stability under bimetallism, our model suggests that a global bimetallic system, in which the gold price of silver fluctuates, has higher price volatility than a global monometallic system.

Some scholars have interpreted this devaluation and debasement as a consequence of the silver influx from the Americas, whereas others have referred to the difficulties that the Ottoman state had to face in financing its war effort against the Safavids in Persia.

The synthesis is based on triethoxysilane chemistry and the reduction of silver without the aid of reductant chemicals. The derived AgNP5@SiO2 nanocomposites are fully characterized and then used for the removal of mercury (11) from aqueous solutions. The results demonstrated that the affinity of the composite for mercury is high and the removal mechanism is adsorption accompanied by a redox reaction between mercury and silver followed by the formation of calomel and amalgams between silver and mercury. The silver-mercury reaction is complex, and its stoichiometry seems to scale with the silver content. Besides the importance of the surface reactions, the successful implementation of biosourced silica for mercury removal from water is useful for the development of strategies for the valorization of agricultural waste and boosts the concept of circular economy and bioeconomy.","[Azat, Seitkhan; Arkhangelsky, Elizabeth; Inglezakis, Vassilis J.] Nazarbayev Univ, Environm Sci & Technol Grp ESTg, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Azat, Seitkhan] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Arkhangelsky, Elizabeth; Inglezakis, Vassilis J.] Nazarbayev Univ, Environm & Resource Efficiency Cluster EREC, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Arkhangelsky, Elizabeth] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Papathanasiou, Thanasis; Inglezakis, Vassilis J.] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Chem & Mat Engn Dept, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Zorpas, Antonis A.] Open Univ Cyprus, Fac Pure & Appl Sci Environm Conservat & Manageme, Lab Chem Engn & Engn Sustainabil, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Abirov, Askar] Inst Sci Tech & Econ Res, Koltobe St 4, Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan",Nazarbayev University; Al-Farabi Kazakh National University; Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Open University of Cyprus,"Inglezakis, VJ (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Environm Sci & Technol Grp ESTg, Astana, Kazakhstan.;Inglezakis, VJ (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Environm & Resource Efficiency Cluster EREC, Astana, Kazakhstan.;Inglezakis, VJ (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn, Chem & Mat Engn Dept, Astana, Kazakhstan.",seytkhan.azat@gmail.com; yelyzaveta.arkhangelsky@nu.edu.kz; athanasios.papathanasiou@nu.edu.kz; askar_abirov@mail.ru; vasileios.inglezakis@nu.edu.kz,"Zorpas, Antonis/AAJ-1495-2020; Abirov, Askar/GYE-2598-2022; papathanasiou, thanasis/ABG-1914-2020; Azat, Seitkhan/A-8633-2015; Inglezakis, Vassilis/F-8554-2013; Arkhangelsky, Elizabeth/G-4152-2012","Abirov, Askar/0000-0002-9767-2481; Azat, Seitkhan/0000-0002-9705-7438; Inglezakis, Vassilis/0000-0002-0195-0417","Nazarbayev University ORAU project Hyperstoichiometry Activity in Metal Nanoparticle Interaction (HYPER Activ), SOE [2015 009]; Nazarbayev University ORAU project Noble metals nanocomposites hyper-activity in heterogeneous non-catalytic and catalytic reactions (HY-PERMAT) [SOE2019012, 110119FD4536]","Nazarbayev University ORAU project Hyperstoichiometry Activity in Metal Nanoparticle Interaction (HYPER Activ), SOE; Nazarbayev University ORAU project Noble metals nanocomposites hyper-activity in heterogeneous non-catalytic and catalytic reactions (HY-PERMAT)","This research was funded by the Nazarbayev University ORAU project Hyperstoichiometry Activity in Metal Nanoparticle Interaction (HYPER Activ), SOE 2015 009 (2015-2018) and partly funded by the Nazarbayev University ORAU project Noble metals nanocomposites hyper-activity in heterogeneous non-catalytic and catalytic reactions (HY-PERMAT), SOE2019012 (2019-2021), Grant Number 110119FD4536.",,52,18,18,3,12,centre Mersenne pour ldition scientifique ouverte,Grenolde Cedex 9,"Cellule Mathdoc Batiment Ceta, 150 Rue de la Chimie CS 40700, Grenolde Cedex 9, FRANCE",1631-0748,1878-1543,,CR CHIM,C.

Here we present (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Ag0.05MnO3-delta as a novel CO2 tolerant cathode of IT-SOFCs, which shows silver intercalation/de-intercalation capability. Under cathodic polarization, silver can be extracted from perovskite lattice to form a 5-15 nm silver modified A-site cation deficient (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3-delta electrode with superior electrocatalytic activity and improved stability. Any performance degradation due to silver sintering can be easily in situ restored by re-intercalating silver into the perovskite lattice under anodic polarization.

A complete sensor was obtained from the compact discs with working, reference and counter electrode made of silver. Chloride ions were detected by exploiting the high affinity of silver with this anion to produce silver chloride. This electrochemical oxidation of silver can be monitored by using an electrochemical technique such as linear scan voltammetry. Indeed, during linear scan voltammetry the oxidation of silver to silver chloride lead to a peak current that increases linearly with chloride concentration. Using this technique, a limit of detection <0.05 mM was found and the electrode shows high selectivity towards many chemicals. In order to very the possibility to recycle waste compact discs, the sensing platform was also obtained from burned compact discs and results shows a negligible interference from the burning process.

I develop an open-economy model to mimic the economic conditions in Imperial Spain. I then present new consumption weights built from primary sources, which I combine with existing price data to produce price indexes for traded and non-traded goods; these are then used to test the implications of the model in a Markov-switching regression framework. I identify a strong and persistent increase in the relative price of non-traded goods coinciding with the silver discoveries, lasting for almost three decades and reversing itself only after the 1575 and 1579 crown bankruptcies.

J,"Merkel, SW",,,,"Merkel, Stephen W.",,,Evidence for the widespread use of dry silver ore in the Early Islamic period and its implications for the history of silver metallurgy,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Archaeometallurgy; Extractive metallurgy; Mining; Early medieval economy; SEM-EDS; Silver; Cupellation,ARCHAEOMETALLURGICAL INVESTIGATIONS; COPPER; COINS; EMPIRE,"Over much of its history, silver production has been tied to lead metallurgy. For the early Middle Ages in particular, it is widely accepted that galena, a lead sulfide, was the dominant source of silver. Since galena can be associated with silver in the range of 0.1-0.5%, rarely more, this implies that tons of lead must have been laboriously processed to extract kilograms of silver. While all extant physical evidence from mines, slag and the metal itself point to this being true, this study has found evidence that extremely rich silver ores must have played a key role in one of the major silver-using polities in the 8th and 9th centuries AD: the Early Islamic Caliphate. Metallography of 26 coins revealed that matte inclusions (silver-copper sulfides) are widely found in Umayyad and Abbasid dirhams, renowned for their exceptionally pure silver. Since matte preserved in the coins could not survive the strongly oxidising refining process required to separate lead from silver, this silver cannot have been produced solely from lead ore or through the use of lead. A new paradigm for the understanding of early medieval extractive metallurgy is required. 'Dry' silver ore consisting of nearly pure silver minerals were processed without lead and made a vital contribution to the Early Islamic silver supply. The results of this study have major technological and economic implications and overturn long-standing views on the history of silver metallurgy. They also have important consequences for provenance studies and the interpretation of elemental and lead isotope data.","[Merkel, Stephen W.] Deutsch Bergbau Museum Bochum, Abt Forsch, Herner Str 45, D-44787 Bochum, Germany; [Merkel, Stephen W.] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England",Leibniz Association; Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum (DBM); University of Oxford,"Merkel, SW (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bergbau Museum Bochum, Abt Forsch, Herner Str 45, D-44787 Bochum, Germany.;Merkel, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, 1 South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3TG, England.",stephenwilliam.merkel@bergbaumuseum.de,,"Merkel, Stephen William/0000-0001-8730-6923",ERC Starting Grant [802349]; European Research Council (ERC) [802349] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"I would like to thank L.

The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been demonstrated to restrain pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses with minimal risk of developing resistance and phytotoxicity. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles via chemical and physical methods raises concerns about environmental safety and production costs. The microbial bio-fabrication of silver nanoparticles is simple, cost-effective and ready-to-use technology. We used Pseudomonas fluorescens cell filtrates to synthesise silver nanoparticles in the current investigation. The silver nanoparticles were characterised using Dynamic Light Scattering, zeta potential (zeta), UV-Vis spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both silver nanoparticles and AgNO3 were tested for their ability to inhibit two phytopathogenic fungi, that is, Fusarium udum and Aspergillus niger. Potent inhibition of mycelial growth was observed when silver nanoparticles were used at a concentration of 150 ppm. However, further research is needed to assess the toxicity of AgNPs before they are mass-produced and used in agricultural applications.","[Sodimalla, Triveni] PJTSAU, Dept Agr Microbiol & Bioenergy, Hyderabad, India; [Yalavarthi, Nagaraju] ANGRAU, Agr Res Stn, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",Acharya N.

Using a structural VAR (SVAR) with blockwise recursive identification, we identify the impact of silver price shocks on the Chinese economy from 1867, when trade data became available, to 1910, one year before the Qing dynasty collapsed. We find that silver price shocks had a sizable impact on both imports and exports but only a very minor effect on the trade balance, only a marginal impact on growth, and almost no effect on domestic prices. Stronger effects were partly mitigated by inelastic export quantities. Generally, the effect of silver price shocks, while considerable, was only short-lived, displaying no persistence in either direction. We find that the bimetallic system in Qing China might have mitigated a potential positive effect of silver depreciation but did not reverse the effect, which - contrary to claims made in the previous literature - was responsible for neither the worsening trade balance nor the inflation and the quickly increasing imports that occurred during our sample period.","[El-Shagi, Makram; Zhang, Lin] Henan Univ, Ctr Financial Dev & Stabil, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [El-Shagi, Makram] Halle Inst Econ Res, Halle, Germany",Henan University; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Ctr Financial Dev & Stabil, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.",lin.zhang@vip.henu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, LIN/0000-0002-6912-5392",,,,,54,4,4,4,52,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We identify two streams of analysis in the literature. On the one hand, scholars observe contentious politics instances where the spread of capitalist production relations enables the associational capacity and bargaining power of social classes. On the other hand, there are voluminous studies on contentious politics in the Global South where groups such as peasants, shopkeepers, and urban poor resist the intensification of the market economy. We use Beverly Silver's distinction between Marx-type and Polanyi-type protests, which focuses on how globalization makes and unmakes social groups, to unpack the heterogeneity of the impacts and experiences of globalization. We argue that although Silver's distinction is of great analytical value, there are strong warrants for separating the effects of the market economy from capitalism in studying contentious politics against globalization. Such an analytical strategy (i) expands the scope of the distinction between Marxian and Polanyian contention to social groups other than the working class and (ii) emphasizes that the roots of these struggles lie in the interconnected diffusion of capitalism and market economy.","[Gemici, Kurtulus; Nair, Manjusha] Natl Univ Singapore, Sociol, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Nair, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sociol, AS1-03-21,11 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",manjusha@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,152,2,3,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-9020,,,SOCIOL COMPASS,Sociol.

As the mainstream conductive ink, it is mostly used in inkjet printing, but its application is limited due to the high sintering temperature. In this paper, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with sodium borohydride. Using silver nanoparticles as basic conductive fillers and graphene or copper nanoparticles as auxiliary conductive fillers, silver conductive inks, silver/graphene conductive inks and silver/copper conductive inks suitable for micro-direct writing printing were prepared. Electrode patterns were printed on photo paper by micro-pen writing printing. The prepared paper electrode can detect nitrate using electrochemical analysis. The results show that the paper electrodes prepared with the three conductive inks can be used for the analysis of potassium ferricyanide and potassium nitrate. The minimum square resistance of paper electrodes prepared with silver conductive ink is 0.11 omega/sq. It can be cycled 60 times in electrochemical applications with small standard deviation and high reproducibility and stability. Analysis and detection can also be performed in nitrate concentrations ranging from 60 mu M to 1000 mu M. This low silver-containing, green, and low resistivity flexible electrode offers a solution for the simplicity and economy of electronic devices.","[Zhao, Chen-Fei; Wang, Jun] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Bioresources Chem & Mat Engn, Xian 710021, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhuo-Qing; Sun, Zhao; Maimaitimin, Zuliaya] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Natl Expt Teaching Demonstrat Ctr Light Chem Engn, Xian 710021, Peoples R China",Shaanxi University of Science & Technology; Shaanxi University of Science & Technology,"Zhao, CF (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Bioresources Chem & Mat Engn, Xian 710021, Peoples R China.",zhaochenfei@sust.edu.cn,"Zhao, Chenfei/GZK-8763-2022","Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2026-2572; Zhao, Chenfei/0000-0003-0077-2951",,,,,28,8,8,8,67,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2196-0216,,,CHEMELECTROCHEM,ChemElectroChem,NOV 15,2022,9,21,,,,,,,e202200948,10.1002/celc.202200948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/celc.202200948,,,9,Electrochemistry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Electrochemistry,5W3GU,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000877807800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

E-waste recycling may contribute significantly to enhance silver recovery in the view of a circular economy and limit the depletion of mineral sources. In this scenario, hydrometallurgical routes represent the most widely used techniques for silver extraction/recovery and require strong acidic solutions, high temperatures, and multiple operating units. An alternative sustainable route for silver recovery from leaching solutions used for silver extraction in industrial applications is herein proposed for the first time. The novel green process of silver recovery is based on the UV/vis light-driven photocatalytic deposition of pure metallic silver over low-cost and non-toxic ZnO photocatalyst. In the second step, ZnO is dissolved by slight acidification and pure metallic silver is easily recovered. Low environmental impact, mild operating conditions, and economic viability are among the major perks of the new silver recovery process developed. In the view of a full-scale implementation, several operating conditions of the recovery process (i.e., photocatalyst load, starting silver concentration, type of hole scavenger and irradiation) were thoroughly investigated. A mathematical model capable of describing the system behaviour under different operating conditions was also developed and allowed to estimate unknown kinetic parameters for the Ag-photodeposition process.","[Muscetta, Marica; Clarizia, Laura; Marotta, Raffaele; Andreozzi, Roberto] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Chim Materiali & Prod Industrial, Naples, Italy; [Race, Marco] Univ Cassino & Lazio Meridionale, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Meccan, Cassino, Italy; [Pirozzi, Francesco] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Edile & Ambientale, Naples, Italy; [Di Somma, Ilaria] CNR, Ist Sci & Tecnol Energia & Mobil Sostenibili, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Cassino; University of Naples Federico II; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie per l'Energia e la Mobilita Sostenibili (STEMS-CNR),"Clarizia, L (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Chim Materiali & Prod Industrial, Naples, Italy.;Race, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Lazio Meridionale, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Meccan, Cassino, Italy.",Laura.clarizia2@unina.it; Marco.race@unicas.it,"Di Somma, Ilaria/C-8907-2016; Race, Marco/I-7049-2019; Muscetta, Marica/ISV-0770-2023","CLARIZIA, LAURA/0000-0003-1508-8212; Muscetta, Marica/0000-0002-8737-2143",,,,,69,10,10,6,40,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The pH, time, concentration, and adsorption temperatures were optimized. It was confirmed that these composites were excellent candidates for use in antimicrobial applications. The silver nanoparticles were produced through chemical synthesis using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent and through adsorption/surface reduction of silver nitrate on eggshell membranes. The composites were thoroughly characterized by various techniques, including spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as agar well diffusion and MTT assay. The results indicate that silver/eggshell membrane composites with excellent antimicrobial properties were produced using both silver nanoparticles and silver nitrate at a pH of 6, 25 & DEG;C, and after 48 h of agitation.

It is proposed here that new silver technology, which initiated the transition from acquiring silver from 'dry' silver ores to silver-bearing lead ores, was introduced to Greece during the time of the Peisistratids (561-510 BCE). Massive exploitation of silver-bearing lead ores at Laurion in Attica, which later financed the construction of a war navy, appears evident in the lead pollution records of Greenland ice, lead isotopic analyses of sixth-century BCE Attic silver coins and late Iron Age Levantine hacksilver, and is reflected in the numbers of lead votive figurines at sanctuaries in Sparta. Against the backdrop of the threat of war with Persia and an imminent Spartan invasion which resulted in the overthrow of Hippias (510 BCE), it is considered that a political transition occurred because Greece was both geologically and politically disposed to adopt this labour-intensive silver technology which helped to initiate, fund and protect the radical social experiment that became known as Classical Greece.","[Wood, Jonathan R.] Univ Liverpool, Archaeol Class & Egyptol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Wood, Jonathan R.] UCL, London, England",University of Liverpool; University of London; University College London,"Wood, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Archaeol Class & Egyptol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",uczljrw@ucl.ac.uk,"Wood, Jonathan/AAM-2355-2021","Wood, Jonathan/0000-0001-6630-6916",,,,,88,4,4,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0003-813X,1475-4754,,ARCHAEOMETRY,Archaeometry,JUN,2023,65,3,,,,,570,586,,10.1111/arcm.12839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/arcm.12839,,NOV 2022,17,"Archaeology; Chemistry, Analytical; Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Archaeology; Chemistry; Geology,F5OA6,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000879546600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The factor supporting the improvement of these indicators are increasing qualifications through further education. The aim of this article is to determine the educational activity of older people, taking into account various forms and directions of education. The author tries to determine the impact of raising qualifications for the development of the silver economy. To achieve the goal of the work, Eurostat data regarding the situation in Poland and Spain against the EU average are used. It is worth noting that continuing education dictated by the requirements of the labor market, in the case of older people, brings additional benefits. On the one hand, participation in educational programs and projects gives a sense of social inclusion, and on the other hand, learning helps to acquire skills of using modern devices to preserve the independence of older people. Encouraging older people to greater learning mobility should be treated as one of possible ways to increase professional activity, but also as a method of combating common age-based stereotypes and biases.","[Sobolewska-Poniedzialek, Ewa] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Sobolewska-Poniedzialek, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Zielona Gora, Poland.",e.sobolewska-poniedzialek@wez.uz.zgora.pl,,"Sobolewska-Poniedzialek, Ewa/0000-0003-4142-681X",,,,,13,1,1,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9998551-2-6,,,,2019,,,,,,,50,58,,,,,,9,Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research; Business & Economics,BO2AN,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000503988800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Greek world extracted Ag and Pb from associated ores, whereas, on the Iberian Peninsula, Carthaginians and Republican-era Romans applied Phoenician cupellation techniques and added exotic Pb to Pb-poor Ag ores. Massive Ag recupellation is observed in Rome during the Second Punic War. After defeating the Carthaginians and the Macedonians in the late second century bce, the Romans brought together the efficient, millennium-old techniques of silver extraction of the Phoenicians, who considered this metal a simple commodity, with the monetization of the economy introduced by the Greeks.","[Albarede, F.; Blichert-Toft, J.; Gentelli, L.; Malod-Dognin, C.; Milot, J.; Telouk, P.; Vaxevanopoulos, M.] Univ Lyon, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, Lyon, France; [De Callatay, F.] Royal Lib Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [De Callatay, F.] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Paris, France; [Davis, G.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Ancient Hist, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Debernardi, P.] Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy; [Gitler, H.] Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel; [Kemmers, F.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Inst Archaolog Wissensch, Frankfurt, Germany; [Klein, S.; Westner, K.] Deutsch Bergbau Museum, Bochum, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Macquarie University; Polytechnic University of Turin; Goethe University Frankfurt; Leibniz Association; Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum (DBM),"Albarède, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS, Lyon, France.",albarede@ens-lyon.fr,"de Callataÿ, François/IUN-5289-2023; Vaxevanopoulos, Markos/A-4480-2019; TELOUK, Philippe/AAY-6708-2021; Albarede, Francis/A-8871-2011; Klein, Sabine/AAD-1543-2022; Westner, Katrin/AAQ-3265-2021; Davis, Gillan/HNP-7826-2023; Blichert-Toft, Janne/C-8280-2012","Klein, Sabine/0000-0002-3939-4428; Gentelli, Liesel/0000-0003-3456-4958; Davis, Gillan/0000-0001-9436-5024; de Callatay, Francois/0000-0002-5381-2534",H2020 European Research Council [741454-SILVER-ERC-2016-ADG],H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors thank the curators of the coin collections of Dusseldorf, Giessen, Heidelberg, Munster and Tubingen for giving permission to sample their collections.

The results provided trace elemental 'fingerprints' of coins minted with silver from known mines, and matching against them revealed the silver sources used in coins, whose mint location could not be identified due to their poor state of preservation. This study proved that, despite the decrease in silver production in European mines in the 17th century and the huge influx of American silver into Europe, in the 18th century, the mints in the Dutch Republic and, to a lesser extent, in the Spanish Netherlands still highly relied on the recycling of older coins and on the import of silver from central European mines.","[Gherardi, Francesca] Ft Cumberland, Invest Sci, Hist England, Portsmouth PO4 9LD, England; [Pelsdonk, Jan] Rijksmuseum, NL-1071 XX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pelsdonk, Jan] TEYLERS MUSEUM, NL-2011 CH HAARLEM, Netherlands",,"Gherardi, F (通讯作者)，Ft Cumberland, Invest Sci, Hist England, Portsmouth PO4 9LD, England.",francesca.gherardi@historicengland.org.uk; duit@live.nl,,"GHERARDI, FRANCESCA/0000-0003-0469-8154","Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (Ministry of Education, Science and Culture) [Rooswijk1740]; EU [871034]","Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (Ministry of Education, Science and Culture); EU(European Union (EU))","The #Rooswijk1740 project is funded and led by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (Ministry of Education, Science and Culture), in collaboration with project partner Historic England and UK-contractor MSDS Marine.

The present study emphasizes the utilization of food waste (FW) and agri-compost media (ACM) as growth media for D. armatus for the subsequent bioremediation potential of XD solution-coupled lipid pro-duction. A 3:1 dilution (FW/ACM: XD.) was found to be suitable for the phycoremediation study of XD solution towards the % removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and silver. The phycoremediation studies of diluted XD solution in FW demonstrated a 74.50% BOD removal, 81.69% COD removal, and 54.70% removal of silver. The growth of D. armatus in diluted XD solution in food waste was 1.37% lipid content. The phycoremediation of diluted XD solution with ACM resulted in 83.05% BOD removal, 88.88% COD removal and 56.30% silver removal with the concomitant lipid production of 1.42%. The optimal biore-mediation coupled lipid production of D. armatus was observed on the 19th day of D. armatus cultivation in the developer effluent, along with food waste and agri-compost media, for 31 days. The study suggests a sustainable utilization of waste (FW and ACM) as a nutritive medium to scrutinize the phycoremediation of XD solution with a concomitant lipid production that can open up new avenues in phycoremediation coupled energy commodities production.","[Sharma, Swati; Kant, Anil; Garlapati, Vijay Kumar] Jaypee Univ Informat & Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Solan 173234, Himachal Prades, India; [Sevda, Surajbhan] Natl Inst Technol Warangal, Dept Biotechnol, Warangal 506004, Telangana, India; [Aminabhavi, Tejraj M.] KLE Technol Univ, Sch Adv Sci, Hubballi 580031, Karnataka, India",Jaypee University of Information Technology; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Warangal; KLE Technological University,"Garlapati, VK (通讯作者)，Jaypee Univ Informat & Technol, Dept Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Solan 173234, Himachal Prades, India.",shanepati@gmail.com,"Aminabhavi, Tejraj/AAY-3470-2021; Sevda, Surajbhan/B-6344-2012; Garlapati, Vijay Kumar/F-2354-2014","Sharma, Swati/0000-0003-3613-1945; Sevda, Surajbhan/0000-0002-8471-5681; Garlapati, Vijay Kumar/0000-0002-8914-3678; Aminabhavi, Tejraj/0000-0002-5613-3916","JUIT, Waknaghat [HP-173234]","JUIT, Waknaghat","Swati Sharma acknowledges JUIT, Waknaghat, HP-173234, India, for providing a research fellowship and facilities.

This shaft has been the result of external pressures and of internal transformations of domestic economies and social structures. Permanent austerity has entailed incisive institutional adaptations and has been accompanied by a 'new politics', centred on a plurality of 'blame avoidance' strategies on the side of parties and governments. The article summarises and discusses the main factual developments since the mid-1970s but it also surveys the main strands of academic debates on both the expansion and the crisis phases. The author argues that comparative welfare state research has been one of the liveliest fields of political economy-a field marked by important analytical and theoretical advances and by the accumulation of relevant and systematic empirical knowledge about a key institution of the European political landscape.","[Ferrera, Maurizio] State Univ Milan, Welfare Stete, Milan, Italy; [Ferrera, Maurizio] Res Unit European Governance URGE, Turin, Italy; [Ferrera, Maurizio] Bocconi Univ, POLEIS Ctr Comparat Polit Studies, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Bocconi University,"Ferrera, M (通讯作者)，State Univ Milan, Welfare Stete, Milan, Italy.",rnaurizio.ferrera@unirni.it,,"ferrera, maurizio/0000-0003-0869-2593",,,,,115,48,66,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0140-2382,1743-9655,,WEST EUR POLIT,West Eur.

Silver nanoparticle is one of the most important particles in these categories. Silver nanoparticles can be converted to the heavy silver metal in water by oxidation. Moreover, in the high amounts of silver concentration, they will be accumulated in different parts of the plant. However, by changing the morphology of the plant, the production will be harmful for human consumptions. In this study, nano-powders with average 50 nm silver particles are mixed with deionized distilled water in a completely randomized design. Seven treatments with various concentrations of suspension silver nanoparticles were prepared and repeated in four different parts of the plant in a regular program of spraying. Samples were analyzed to study the growth indexes and concentration of silver in different parts of the plant. It was observed that with increasing concentration of silver nanoparticles on cucumber, the growth indexes (except pH fruit), and the concentration of silver heavy metal are increased significantly. The incremental concentration had the linear relationship with correlation coefficient 0.95 and an average of 0.617 PPM by increasing of each unit in one thousand concentration of nanosilver. Although, by increasing concentration of silver nanoparticles as spraying form, the plant morphological characteristics were improved, the concentration of silver heavy metal in various plant organs was increased. These results open a new pathway to consider the effect of nanoparticles on plant's productions for human consumptions.","[Shams, Gholamabbas; Ranjbar, Morteza] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Phys, Shiraz, Iran; [Amiri, Aliasghar] Islamic Azad Univ, Shiraz Branch, Dept Chem, Shiraz, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Shams, G (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Phys, Shiraz, Iran.",ghs@iaushiraz.net,"Shams, Gholamabbas/AAR-1154-2020; Ranjbar, Morteza/M-8872-2018","Shams, Gholamabbas/0000-0003-2649-4726; Ranjbar, Morteza/0000-0003-2410-240X","research center, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran","research center, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran","The results of this article are obtained from the research plan entitle: The effect of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles on concentration of silver heavy element in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. negeen).

I analyze, then, the interaction between coerced and free labor mitayos and mingas and emphasize their interconnection with k'ajchas (selfemployed workers) and the rudimentary ore mills known as trapiches. The article demonstrates how k'ajchas and trapiches contested the property rights of the traditional Spanish mine- and millowners in Potosi. I also highlight the key role of women in refining and trading ores, which challenges standard gender assumptions about mining labor.

However, silver is incorporated into the jarosite specie during the pressure oxidation and cyanide, leaching of the residue yields very low silver extraction. In this work, iodide was added to the pressure oxidation of zinc-lead-iron complex sulphides to prevent the deportment of silver ions into the jarosite phase. At low temperature range (110-130 degreesC), the silver ions were completely sequenced into the silver iodide phase because of the fast precipitation kinetics of silver iodide and its stability at low temperatures. The leaching of the residue in cyanide solution yielded high silver extraction (above 90%). Silver extraction from the residue decreased when the pressure oxidation was conducted at high temperatures (140-150 degreesC). At this temperature range, the enhanced stability and the precipitation kinetics of the jarosite specie posed a challenge by competing (with iodide) for silver ions. This competition was minimised by using moderately high initial acid for the pressure oxidation. High zinc extraction was achieved during the pressure oxidation. Also, there were appreciable iron precipitation and acid neutralisation of the slurry. The resulting pregnant solution is suitable for zinc recovery by electrowinning and the residue can be leached for silver and gold extraction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We propose variants of three well-known and commonly used heuristics (Wagner-Whitin, Silver-Meal and Least Unit Cost) adapted for this particular setting. In an extensive numerical study with demands exhibiting stationary, increasing and decreasing trends and seasonality, we demonstrate that having longer forecast horizon is less effective in obtaining more cost effective production plans when the production cost function is convex and also when fixed setup cost is lower, which both are proxy to lack of economies-of-scale.","[Kian, Ramez; Yazdani, Baback] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England; [Kian, Ramez; Rezazadeh, Hassan] Univ Tabriz, Dept Ind Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Berk, Emre] Bilkent Univ, Dept Management, Ankara, Turkey; [Gurler, Ulku] Bilkent Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Ankara, Turkey",Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham; University of Tabriz; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Kian, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England.;Kian, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tabriz, Dept Ind Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",ramez.kian@ntu.ac.uk,"Rezazadeh, Hassan/GPW-7036-2022; Berk, Emre/GXF-2453-2022","Kian, Ramez/0000-0001-8786-6349; berk, emre/0000-0001-9674-5194; Yazdani, Baback/0000-0001-9484-8552","Iran's National Elites Foundation, I.R.

The linear system concludes because of rising consumption, production, and economic growth, which makes the system out of resources and results in economic crisis and environmental pollution. The rolling window approach used in the study provides detailed information regarding the relationship between carbon emissions and the circular economy in the Netherlands from 2000:01 to 2020:12. In the full sample causality, the finding reveals the positive influence of the circular economy on carbon emissions. The rolling window explores the causal impact in the sub-sample when there is a time-varying effect. It finds that the circular economy has a negative influence on carbon emissions in certain sub-samples due to a variety of causes. On the other hand, carbon emissions have improved the circular economy's ability to address environmental challenges. Thus, our findings prove the existence of a reciprocal link between the circular economy and carbon emissions. Tran-sitioning to the circular economy setup requires the comprehensive development of models for controlling emissions. The detailed understanding derived from the circular economy will help policymakers to plan the policy for mitigating environmental issues.","[Khan, Khalid] Qilu Univ Technol, Sch Finance, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Su, Chi Wei] Qingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Khurshid, Adnan] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinhua, Peoples R China",Qilu University of Technology; Qingdao University; Zhejiang Normal University,"Khurshid, A (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jinhua, Peoples R China.",khalid.khan665@gmail.com; cwsu7137@gmail.com; adnankhurshid83@gmail.com,"Su, Chi/ABE-4976-2021; khan, khalid/AAL-6059-2021; Khurshid, Adnan/HCI-7538-2022","Khurshid, Adnan/0000-0002-1598-1097",,,,,56,36,36,4,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

This paper estimates the impact of the statutory CIT rate, as applied to mining companies, on FDI inflows to the gold and silver sectors of African economies. The estimation results indicate that the impact of the mining CIT rate on the host country's gold and silver FDI inflows is negative, but not statistically significant, at the conventional levels of significance. These results suggest that cuts in the CIT rate applied to mining companies will not necessarily attract FDI to gold and silver projects. Moreover, we find a strategic complementarity in gold and silver FDI inflows between countries, suggesting that an increase in the host country's gold and silver FDI inflows may stimulate FDI to gold and silver projects in neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the results show that infrastructure, government stability and gold and silver reserves positively affect gold and silver FDI inflows. The main findings of the paper suggest that, instead of granting corporate tax incentives, governments may consider improving the quality of socio-economic infrastructure, the availability of geological information and promoting political and economic stability for attracting mining investments.","[Coulibaly, Seydou] African Dev Bank, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Camara, Abdramane] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, 26,Ave Leon Blum, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",African Development Bank Group (AfDB); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Camara, A (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, 26,Ave Leon Blum, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",abdramane.camara@doctorant.uca.fr,,"COULIBALY, SEYDOU/0000-0001-9381-2056",,,,,66,2,3,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1017-6772,1467-8268,,AFR DEV REV,Afr.

Natural antimicrobial substitutes to traditional antibiotics represent an essential tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Nanotechnology has shown considerable potential in different research fields, and the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles are known. Silver has been used for medical purposes since ancient times because of its bactericidal properties, and the highly reactive surfaces of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) indicate that they might have a function in antimicrobial applications. This work aimed to study the antimicrobial properties of biologically produced AgNPs from Origanum vulgare leaves compared to chemically produced AgNPs. Both types were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, TEM, and dynamic light scattering and tested against three bacterial strains (Streptococcus agalactiae , and Aeromonas hydrophila , both isolated from Nile tilapia and Vibrio alginolyticus , isolated from sea bass) and three fungal strains (Aspergillus flavus , Fusarium moniliforme , and Candida albicans , all isolated from Nile tilapia). Disk diffusion test and evaluation of ultrastructure changes of tested microorganisms treated with AgNPs by transmission electron microscopy were performed. Moreover, the hemolytic properties of AgNPs were studied on chicken and goat red blood cells. The results obtained declare that the green biological production of silver nanoparticles is safer and more effective than the chemical one; moreover, AgNPs have interesting dose-dependent antimicrobial properties, with better results for biologically produced ones; their effectiveness against tested bacterial and fungal strains opens the way to their use to limit fish diseases, increase economy and improve human health.

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing.

Respecting the Circular Economy principle, the ONCs are prepared starting from the treatment of agriculture bagasse waste with ammonium persulfate-APS. This method permits to obtain ONCs fibers with rod or whisker shapes, with size and length in the range 6-10 nm and 90-150 nm, respectively. Ag-ONCs are then fabricated using a green photochemical approach. The UV irradiation works as radical initiator for the silver reduction, in water solution and at room temperature. The ONCs act as a template and reducing agent for silver nanoparticles formation, due to the specific hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the cellulose surface. The structural and morphological properties of ONCs and Ag-ONCs nanocomposite are well evaluated by FT-IR, XRD, UV-Vis, AFM, SEM and TEM characterizations. The results showed that well crystalline, quasi-spherical silver nanoparticles of about 4-10 nm dispersed in the ONCs matrix are fabricated. Qualitative antibacterial tests towards gram negative (Escherichia coliandPseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (Staphylococcus aureusandBacillus subtilis) bacteria are carried out and the results demonstrated that the Ag-ONCs inhibit the bacteria growth, with 12-14 mm of inhibition zone for both the bacteria groups. Also, quantitative antibacterial tests forE. coli, chosen as representative for its diffusion, are carried out and the bacteria growth rate and the inhibition rate for Ag-ONCs at different concentrations are evaluated. The analysis showed that the MIC (minimum inhibition concentration) for Ag is about 110 mu g/mL forE. coli.

Recent developments in the silver economy have underscored the substantial demand for these products, yet their development is frequently impeded by the absence of holistic design frameworks that encompass system design, technology, business strategy, and emotional considerations. To bridge this gap, our study employs a standardized Grounded Theory methodology to analyze product data and customer reviews from e-commerce platforms, supplemented by insights from interviews with four leading product designers in this sector. This analysis led to the creation of the 'Silver Model' for gerontechnology product design. This model integrates essential design aspects across eight domains, offering a comprehensive framework that harmonizes technological capabilities with the expectations of elderly users. This research advances the theoretical foundations of gerontechnology and furnishes a pragmatic blueprint for enhancing product design in the silver market, significantly contributing to the advancement of age-friendly technology and promoting both social and economic sustainability.","[Wei, Yuxiang] City Univ Macau, Fac Innovat & Design, Macau 999078, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiang] Ningbo Tech Univ, Sch Design, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China",City University of Macau,"Chen, J (通讯作者)，Ningbo Tech Univ, Sch Design, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China.",u22092110230@cityu.edu.mo; chenjiang@nbt.edu.cn,"Wei, Yuxiang/KYQ-5192-2024","Wei, Yuxiang/0009-0005-8383-5939",,,,,69,0,0,27,27,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2025,17,1,,,,,,,42,10.3390/su17010042,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17010042,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,R8K1C,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001393858400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analyses in the paper are based on micro-data from the Social Insurance Agency in Slovakia. According to the results the income polarization in Slovakia is deepening and economic performance of a number of districts is lowering. This results in extreme barriers for regional consumption at present, as well as threat of generation of significantly low level of pensions in the future.

The theory of salutogenesis, focusing on health, rather than the disease itself, provides evidence that space contributes to health and well-being. This has influenced healthcare architecture through facilities designed to support well-being. So, increasingly healthcare facilities aim to look like hotels to improve user experience. This retains conceptual and usage gaps between hospitality and healthcare but supports cross-fertilization of best practice. This paper explores possibilities of synergies between healthcare facilities and hospitality industry. Appropriate services and well-being across the lifespan is the ultimate objective, and the physical environment is critical in that provision. Examining the architectural typology of the dementia village as case study, it explores healthcare-hospitality hybrids.

The use of these wound dressing systems against Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated in terms of biofilm adhesion, inhibition halo assays, and time-kill assays as a function of the nature of reducing agent applied in the production of silver nanoparticles.","[Guimaraes, Milena Lima; Gomes da Silva Jr, Fernando Antonio; de Souza, Anderson Miranda; da Costa, Mateus Matiuzzi; de Oliveira, Helinando Pequeno] Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco, Inst Mat Sci, Ave Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 510, BR-48902300 Juazeiro, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco,"de Oliveira, HP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco, Inst Mat Sci, Ave Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 510, BR-48902300 Juazeiro, BA, Brazil.",helinando.oliveira@univasf.edu.br,"Costa, Mateus/I-5631-2013; Guimaraes, Milena/KIA-2455-2024; Souza, Anderson/C-3042-2019; de Oliveira, Helinando/J-1776-2012","Matiuzzi da Costa, Mateus/0000-0002-9884-2112; de Oliveira, Helinando/0000-0002-7565-5576",CAPES; FACEPE; FINEP; CNPq,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FACEPE(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE)); FINEP(Financiadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was supported by CAPES, FACEPE, FINEP and CNPq.",,52,2,2,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5509,2190-5517,,APPL NANOSCI,Appl.

In this work we present results from the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on copper/silver alloy electrodes alongside pure copper and pure silver in acetonitrile-water electrolyte mixtures. EIS measurements show that the copper/silver alloys exhibit lower charge-transfer resistance when compared to the pure metal electrodes. Reduced product analysis identifies carbon monoxide (CO) as the major product on pure Ag, Ag with alloyed with 10% Cu, and Cu alloyed with 10% Ag with Faradaic efficiencies over 60%. Formate is the major reduced product close to the 50:50 (Cu:Ag) ratio with Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 30%.

A chemometric approach based on experimental design was used to find the best conditions for the leaching process based on a combined base-activated persulfate and ammonia system while a novel method known as electrodeposition-redox replacement was used to recover it. A remarkable pure silver recovery of 98.7 +/- 1.4 % was achieved. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis confirmed the enrichment of Ag particles on the electrode. Overall, these promising results showed how flexible the electrodeposition-redox replacement approach is in producing a range of valuable functional materials from intricate hydrometallurgical solutions including multiple metal impurities.","[Russo, Raffaele Emanuele; Awais, Muhammad; Fattobene, Martina; Santoni, Elisa; Zamponi, Silvia; Conti, Paolo; Berrettoni, Mario] Univ Camerino, Sch Sci & Technol, ChIP Bldg, I-62032 Camerino, Italy; [Cavallera, Rebecca; Giuli, Gabriele] Univ Camerino, Sch Sci & Technol, Geol Div, I-62032 Camerino, Italy",University of Camerino; University of Camerino,"Berrettoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Camerino, Sch Sci & Technol, ChIP Bldg, I-62032 Camerino, Italy.",mario.berrettoni@unicam.it,"Russo, Raffaele Emanuele/KQO-2992-2024","Russo, Raffaele Emanuele/0000-0001-6362-6201; Cavallera, Rebecca/0009-0005-2865-0368",Ministero dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare - Direzione generale per l'economia circolare; FAR UNICAM; MIUR,"Ministero dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare - Direzione generale per l'economia circolare; FAR UNICAM; MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We acknowledge the Italian CRG beamline at ESRF (LISA-BM08) and we would like to thank D'Acapito Francesco, Alessandro Puri, Jacopo Orsilli and Simone Margheri for assistance in performing the experiment.

Renewable energy can be scaled up to the range of 12 electric terawatts (TWe) if 10% of continental shelves are exploited with floating turbines to depths as low as 225 m, 5% of continents with ground turbines, and 5% of the main deserts with concentrating solar power (CSP) farms. However, a globally electrified economy cannot grow much above 12 TWe without approaching the limit of terrestrial copper reserves. New photovoltaic silicon panels do not use silver metallization pastes and could contribute up to 1 TW of decentralized residential power. Hydroelectricity has a potential of 1 TW but a fraction of this would have to be sacrificed for energy storage purposes. Hydro, CSP, wave energy and grid integration at continental scales may be sufficient to fit supply to demand, avoiding intermittency. The renewable energy mix would have an energy return on energy invested about 18, which is 25% lower than the estimated present one. That should be sufficient to sustain an industrialized economy provided that the substitution of electricity for fossil fuels is done intelligently.","[Garcia-Olivares, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Ps Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM),"García-Olivares, A (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Ps Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",agolivares@icm.csic.es,,"Garcia-Olivares, Antonio/0000-0003-0052-101X",,,,,67,11,12,2,18,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,MADRID,"VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN",0214-8358,1886-8134,,SCI MAR,Sci.

EU Member States are ageing. The demand for specialised housing for older adults and ambient assisted living technologies is expected to triple in the next 40 years. The ageing population is driving the expenditures of health care (HC) and long-term care (LTC) provision without visible improvement in the quality of life of older adults. Ambient assisted living technologies and ambient intelligence can enable residents to live longer in their own homes and in specialised housing in the community while mitigating the increasing public expenditures for health care and long-term care. We present the results of the survey, how older adults in Slovenia perceive the ambient assisted living housing, where large share of older adults, who are already included in municipality home care programs, want to live after a severe decline in their functional capacities. These results enable us to forecast the dynamics of the expected demand for specialised housing for older adults and the expected directions of the development of specialised housing and the supply networks. We present the multiple decrement model to forecast the dynamics of this demand when developing the silver economy. This structure of demand, we show, depends on the demographic and the income of the older adults. Therefore, it influences the probabilities of transitions in a multiple decrement model for forecasting the dynamics of development of specialised housing with embedded AAL technologies for older adults.

Nevertheless, women were actively involved in the early stages of silver mining in Potosi, when traditional technologies were still in use. They also played an important role in the local ore market. After the introduction of new technology and the reorganization of the labour force, the process of refining ore was much more complicated. Women then participated in some stages of the process: in selecting the ores and sieving. This implies that mining is a complex process with a labour and gender division that has been underrated and underestimated. More importantly, women became owners of rudimentary mills (trapiches) where the ore was processed, selling different amounts of silver to the Spanish authorities, making their living in this way.","[Romano, Rossana Barragan] Int Inst Social Hist, Cruquiusweg 31, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; International Institute of Social History (IISH-KNAW),"Romano, RB (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Hist, Cruquiusweg 31, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",rba@iisg.nl,,,,,,,61,5,6,1,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0020-8590,1469-512X,,INT REV SOC HIST,Int.

From census records, surveys, and tribute tallies, we know that indigenous men and women represented the majority of miners and refiners in the silver centers of Potosi and Zacatecas, but because they left little written evidence of their work, their intellectual and technical contributions remain underappreciated in the historiography. By tracing terms that European translators of Alvaro Alonso Barba's_Arte de los metales_(Madrid, 1640) understand (which tend to reflect familiar concepts in natural philosophy) and misunderstand (which tend to reflect Hispanized forms of Quechua and Aymara), we can use the language of colonial mining and metallurgy to identify where and how indigenous ways of knowing provided key technical vocabularies in the science of American silver. Recovering some of the Andean intellectual and etymological roots of colonial amalgamation technologies also provides a new way of thinking about the incorporation of indigenous knowledge into extractive industries that figured prominently in the early modern making of the black legend.

J,"Ho, TK",,,,"Ho, Tai-kuang",,,Dilemma of the Silver Standard Economies: The Case of China,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY,"Exchange rate commitments implied in the silver standard originally anchored China's monetary policy and the inflation rate in the early republican period. It was believed that China's free silver standard acted as a natural check on the excessive issuing of notes by warlords and local governments. This consensus view, however, overlooks the fact that the silver standard was inherently unstable because it left no room for monetary policy to stabilize output and inflation. This article employs a formal structural model to show that a fiat currency unlinked to fluctuations in the price of silver that allows government to implement self-adjusting monetary policies would further stabilize China's output and inflation. If the external price level is unstable, we cannot keep both our own price level and our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose. ... Our conclusions up to this point are, therefore, that, when stability of the internal price level and stability of the external exchanges are incompatible, the former is generally preferable; and that on occasions when the dilemma is acute, the preservation of the former at the expense of the latter is, fortunately perhaps, the line of least resistance.

Previous research mostly analyzed the labor market participation of people aged between 55 and 65. However, as the raising of the retirement age is on the agenda in several European countries, the ability and willingness of the 65+ age group to work has become a key issue. Our questionnaire survey conducted in Hajdu-Bihar county, North-Eastern Hungary (N = 2,625, multistage probability sample) focused on this age group, which has received relatively little attention in research with respect to their labor market status. It investigated participation in the formal and informal labor market, the time management of the 65+ age group, and the factors that determine their willingness to work. Our analysis revealed that only a rather small proportion (2.7%) of the investigated age group is engaged in the formal economy, and the vast majority (93%) is not engaged in any gainful activity even in the informal economy. However, in 68.7% of the sample we can identify certain activities that aim to reduce expenses and can be clearly considered as work. Thus the members of the Silver Generation are working to a considerably higher degree than official employment statistics show. The primary obstacle for open labor market involvement is not age but rather education level and health status. According to our research, the level of employment of the 65+ age group is highly affected by the lack of pressing financial need and also by ageism. A total of 99.2% of the respondents possess transfer incomes that cover their living expenses, so in their case there is no financial constraint forcing them to return to the open labor market.

It explores the causes for and responses to the decline of Chinese coastal resorts. The data were collected through in-depth interviews with twelve local key information providers, and secondary information sources such as government archives, survey reports, and resort plans. It was found that the rise and fall of Chinese coastal resorts in the last three decades is closely linked to the transitional reform from a central planned economy to a market economy. Three stages of coastal tourism development were identified in a sequence of rapid growth, decline and redevelopment. It was government financial funds and high local government involvement that promoted the rapid expansion of coastal resorts during the 1980s. However, coastal resort decline occurred when transitional reform was intensified and deflationary policy executed after 1992. Institutional failure is found to be the main reason of Chinese coastal resorts decline since the mid-1990s. The government-dominated pattern could not be sustained and should be restructured in forthcoming coastal tourism development in China. Revival strategies should emphasize enhancing market-oriented reform in the declining resorts on both supply and demand sides.","[Bao Jigang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Tourism Planning & Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu Jun] S China Normal Univ, Dept Tourism Management, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; South China Normal University,"Bao, JG (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Tourism Planning & Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",eesbjg@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70703012]; Cutural and Social Foundation of National Education Ministry [11YJAZH059],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Cutural and Social Foundation of National Education Ministry,"Foundation item: Under the auspices of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 70703012), Cutural and Social Foundation of National Education Ministry (No. 11YJAZH059)",,26,3,3,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

This paper aims to investigate the integrated valorization of silver mine tailings (RST) through the recovery of residual silver by froth flotation and ecofriendly use of the resulting treated tailings (SMT) to manufacture ceramic materials. Treated silver mine tailings (SMT) sample was mixed with natural clays in different proportions to prepare the desired formulations. Samples were then pressed, dried and sintered at various temperatures (900, 950, 1,000 and 1,050 degrees C) for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 degrees C/min. The mineralogical compositions, physical, mechanical, microstructural and environmental properties of the sintered ceramics were assessed. The main results show that the mechanical resistance of sintered ceramics decreases with the addition of SMT. However, increasing the sintering temperature allows to improve the mechanical performance of ceramics. Also, water absorption was improved with the increase of sintering temperature due to the decrease of open pores. The leaching behavior of pollutants from sintered ceramics was also evaluated according to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The released concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo and Pb were below the requested limits for non-hazardous waste set by US-EPA regulations.","[Drif, Boujemaa; Hakkou, Rachid] Cadi Ayyad Univ UCA, Fac Sci & Technol, IMED Lab, BP 549, Marrakech 40000, Morocco; [Taha, Yassine; Hakkou, Rachid; Benzaazoua, Mostafa] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Min Environm & Circular Econ EMEC, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [Benzaazoua, Mostafa] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Mines & Environm, 445 Blvd Univ, Rouyn Noranda, PQ J9X 5E4, Canada",Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; University of Quebec; University Quebec Abitibi-Temiscamingue,"Taha, Y (通讯作者)，Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Min Environm & Circular Econ EMEC, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco.",yassine.taha@um6p.ma,"Taha, Yassine/N-3181-2018; Hakkou, Rachid/H-5867-2013; Benzaazoua, Mostafa/F-8616-2015",,,,,,41,15,16,4,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0892-6875,,,MINER ENG,Miner.

Lignin, a wood-derived biomacromolecule, holds great potential as a renewable feedstock, but efficient depolymerization and dearomatization methods are required to fully unlock its potential. In this investigation, we present a silver-catalyzed aqueous electrocatalytic method for the selective depolymerization and partial dearomatization of soda lignin under mild, ambient conditions. Utilizing a water/sodium carbonate solvent system and a silver electrode to mediate the electrochemical reduction, we achieved significant lignin depolymerization over reaction times ranging from 5 to 20 h. Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) revealed sodium levulinate, sodium acetate, and sodium formate as the main aliphatic products, alongside various aromatic species in the depolymerized lignin products (DL). This selective conversion of lignin into both valuable aromatic compounds and reactive aliphatic intermediates offers promising opportunities for further synthesis of a wide range of organic chemicals, contributing to the development of a more sustainable and circular economy.","[Lindenbeck, Lucie; Brand, Silas; Stallmann, Franka; Barra, Vanessa; Beele, Bjoern B.; Slabon, Adam; Rodrigues, Bruno V.

Heterocycles play a significant role in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry, the agricultural industry and materials science. Among heterocycles, N-heterocycles constitute a large family. Their ubiquity in living and non-living systems makes them an endless topic for research. Being a part of the research community, we need to balance environmental concerns with scientific and economic development. So, research that is coherent with nature is a trending domain at all times. Silver catalysis possesses a greener face in organic synthesis. The simple, rich and extensive chemistry shown by silver makes it an attractive choice for catalysis. Inspired by its versatility and uniqueness we have compiled here recent developments in the silver-catalyzed synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles since 2019. The high efficiency, regioselectivity, chemoselectivity, recyclability of the catalytic system, greater atom economy and simple reaction setup are the major highlights of this protocol. It is a hot research topic which is evident from the large number of works carried out for the fabrication of a range of N-heterocycles with varying complexities.","[Devi, P.

The study found that farmers with hard clam stocking densities higher than 1,500,000 individuals/ha (high-density farmers) generated more profit than farmers with stocking densities below 1,500,000 individuals/ha (low-density farmers), because they experienced lower average costs and higher production outputs. Moreover, the own price elasticity of labor input (-1.162) was more responsive to price changes for high-density farmers than for low-density farmers. That is, wage increases have a significant effect on reducing labor demand for high-density farmers. For these farmers, the Allen partial cross-price elasticities of the variable inputs labor-seed and labor-feed were 1.973 and 2.326, respectively. These positive elasticities indicate that labor-seed and labor-feed are substitutes. That is, increases in seed and feed prices could be compensated for by increasing labor inputs for high-density farmers. This study established the existence of constant overall scale economies and economies of scope for high-and low-density farmers. In addition, the study suggests that hard clam farmers with fish and shrimp polycultures consider cost complementarities and product-specific economies of scope at various levels of production. Low-density farmers are also advised to increase the milkfish population in their polycultures, whereas high-density farmers might increase silver sea bream and shrimp densities.","[Yeh, Chun-Yuan; Schafferer, Christian] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Int Trade, Taichung, Taiwan; [Huang, Jung-Fu] Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Dept Aquaculture, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lee, Jie-Min] Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Dept Shipping & Transportat Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology,"Lee, JM (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Marine Univ, Dept Shipping & Transportat Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",iune@ocu.edu.tw; jfhuang@webmail.nkmu.edu.tw; jmlee866@yahoo.com.tw; chris@ocu.edu.tw,"Schafferer, Christian/GWC-1369-2022","Schafferer, Christian/0000-0003-1167-1865",Group Administration of Formosa Plastic Group,Group Administration of Formosa Plastic Group,This work was financially supported by the Group Administration of Formosa Plastic Group.,,28,4,4,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0967-6120,1573-143X,,AQUACULT INT,Aquac.

In this work we consider the capacity design problem for a meshrestorable optical network supporting any mixture of four basic quality of protection (QoP) classes. The service definitions are (gold): assured restorability, (silver): best efforts, (bronze): non-protected and (economy): preemptible service. We give design models for optimal capacity design of span-restorable (or corresponding link-protected) mesh networks having any particular mixture of these service classes. We also apply and test the design models under several multi-QoP test case scenarios to gain insights about various strategies and options possible in a multi-QoP design environment. An interesting finding is that in some test cases, 15 to 30% of all demand can be in the gold class enjoying 100% restorability solely through preemption of economy class service capacity. This suggests the potential to design and operate mesh-based networks that have no spare capacity at all in the conventional sense: all capacity is bearing service of some paying type. The resulting frequency of preemption in the economy class services is also studied. Results also show typically high levels of best-efforts restorability in the silver class occurring in networks that are strictly designed only for the restorability of the gold class services. High restorability of best effort services, however, requires the preemption of economy services. These methods and findings can be used by network and business planners to evaluate a number of different service structuring, pricing, and capacity-design strategies that may offer advantages to them and new options for their customers.","Univ Alberta, TR Labs, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta,"Univ Alberta, TR Labs, Edmonton, AB T6G 2V4, Canada.",grover@trlabs.ca; matthieu.clouqueur@siemens.com,,,,,,,11,9,14,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1387-974X,1572-8188,,PHOTONIC NETW COMMUN,Photonic Netw.

The fabricated PEC sensor was based on Ag-S coordination chemistry and the collective oscillatory motion of electrons resulting from the coherent excitation of the free electrons in the conduction band of silver nanoparticles. The energetic electrons from the surface plasmon of the silver nanoparticles may be injected into the conduction band of the hierarchically structured zinc oxide and then fast transferred to the ITO electrode. However, the enhanced photocurrent produced by the plasmonic silver nanoparticles can be efficiently inhibited due to the bonding of Ag-S upon the simulated sunlight irradiation and at the bias voltage of 0.2 V. Under the optimized condition, the fabricated PEC sensor was linear with the concentration of L-cysteine in the range from 0.67 to 34.77 pmol L-1 with the detection limit of 0.21 pmol L-1. The presence of definite concentration of conventional species did not interfere in the detection of L-cysteine and the results agreed well with those obtained by HPLC. This novel plasmonic PEC sensor has good performances in high sensitivity, good selectivity, easy operation, economy, short detection time, and portability. The strategy of localized surface plasmon resonance by in situ generation of silver nanoparticles provides an alternative way to construct a PEC sensor of L-cysteine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, until now, research on silver production technology in its social-economic and environmental contexts has been limited. Here we present a unique silver-lead production site in Hebei province, north China, dated between the 12th and 13th century AD, yielding vast numbers of slag-filled tubular crucibles and coal-ash slag chunks. Microstructural and chemical analysis reveals the crucibles were manufactured from refractory clays and that the slag inside contains lead silver particles, un-reacted ore and numerous fragments of metallic iron. These finds indicate that the crucibles were used for smelting argentiferous sulphidic lead ores, which were reduced to metal by desulphurization using metallic iron. Mineral coal was employed to fuel this process from outside the crucibles. The use of mineral coal and externally-fired crucibles for smelting was an important technological innovation, but not one that could be adopted by all industries. We argue that it was most likely associated with rampant deforestation and the fuel crisis historically documented for the early second millennium in northern China. Contrary to received wisdom, this study demonstrates that the early adoption of coal was not as widespread as typically assumed, as it required a range of technological innovations. Crucible smelting, as one of the solutions, was embraced by lead-silver smelters, while most iron smelters in this period still persisted with the charcoal-fired furnace smelting tradition.","[Liu, Siran; Qian, Wei] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Inst Cultural Heritage & Hist Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rehren, Thilo] Cyprus Inst, STARC, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Rehren, Thilo] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London, England; [Qin, Dashu; Chen, Jianli] Peking Univ, Sch Archaeol & Museol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wenli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hist Nat Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Martinon-Torres, Marcos] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Cambridge, England; [Huang, Xin] Cultural Rel Inst Hebei Prov, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China","University of Science & Technology Beijing; University of London; University College London; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute for the History of Natural Science, CAS; University of Cambridge","Liu, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Inst Cultural Heritage & Hist Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",siran.liu@ustb.edu.cn,"Rehren, Thilo/C-1567-2008; Martinon-Torres, Marcos/C-2397-2008; Liu, Siran/AAK-9317-2020; Chen, Jianli/D-2352-2013","chen, Jianli/0000-0002-3124-7327; Rehren, Thilo/0000-0002-9169-1198; Martinon-Torres, Marcos/0000-0003-2124-2837; Liu, Siran/0000-0001-9250-4561",Sino-British Fellowship Trust; Institute for Archaeo-Metallugical Studies; Rio Tinto Ltd.; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51704023]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17ZDA178],Sino-British Fellowship Trust; Institute for Archaeo-Metallugical Studies; Rio Tinto Ltd.; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This research was part of SRL's PhD work at UCL, supervised by ThR and MMT.

In this paper, we critique this individualising approach and instead explore hope discourse as an emergent social phenomenon, focusing on how it is constructed and managed in inspirational meetings about the circular economy. Using critical discursive psychology as a methodology, we identify three interpretative repertoires through which hope is constructed: stronger together, change for real, silver lining. We explore what is accomplished by their use, and discuss the social implications within the meetings and beyond. The repertoires facilitate a positive meeting experience and solidarity amongst participants. However, hope discourse also relies on abstraction which prohibits disagreement, critique, and talk about concrete actions.","[Ahlvik, Therese; Bergea, Hanna; Rodl, Malte B.; Hallgren, Lars] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Div Environm Commun, Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ahlvik, T (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Div Environm Commun, Uppsala, Sweden.",therese.ahlvik@slu.se,,,"FORMAS, Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development [2018-01874]; SLU Future Food; Vinnova [2018-01874] Funding Source: Vinnova; Formas [2018-01874] Funding Source: Formas","FORMAS, Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development(Swedish Research Council Formas); SLU Future Food; Vinnova(Vinnova); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This research received financial support by FORMAS, Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development, grant number 2018-01874, and by SLU Future Food.",,55,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-0568,1360-0559,,J ENVIRON PLANN MAN,J.

The few reported measurements have been extrapolated to infer the performance of ancient economies, including comparisons of economic productivity and growth during the Roman Republican and Imperial periods. These studies were based on sparse sampling and inaccurate dating, limiting understanding of trends and specific linkages. Here we show, using a precisely dated record of estimated lead emissions between 1100 BCE and 800 CE derived from subannually resolved measurements in Greenland ice and detailed atmospheric transport modeling, that annual European lead emissions closely varied with historical events, including imperial expansion, wars, and major plagues. Emissions rose coeval with Phoenician expansion, accelerated during expanded Carthaginian and Roman mining primarily in the Iberian Peninsula, and reached a maximum under the Roman Empire. Emissions fluctuated synchronously with wars and political instability particularly during the Roman Republic, and plunged coincident with two major plagues in the second and third centuries, remaining low for > 500 years. Bullion in silver coinage declined in parallel, reflecting the importance of lead-silver mining in ancient economies. Our results indicate sustained economic growth during the first two centuries of the Roman Empire, terminated by the second-century Antonine plague.","[McConnell, Joseph R.; Arienzo, Monica M.; Chellman, Nathan J.] Desert Res Inst, Div Hydrol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [McConnell, Joseph R.] Univ Oxford, All Souls Coll, Oxford OX1 4AL, England; [Wilson, Andrew I.] Univ Oxford, Fac Class, Oxford OX1 3LU, England; [Wilson, Andrew I.; Thompson, Elisabeth M.; Pollard, A.

Social Infrastructure is a subset of the infrastructure sector and typically includes assets that accommodate social services and support networks. Housing and utilities with the added value of 850 billion EUR per year represent the highest share of European Silver economy. Investments in housing and age-friendly built environment should be made with the criterion to accommodate declining functional capacities of ageing residents. Their functional capacities are decreasing and require the development of specialised housing stock for independent living in a community. The structure of housing stock and the development of supply networks and services for older adults, including nursing and social care, do not follow the dynamics of population ageing. Based on the literature review we present the dynamics of publications for the most frequently discussed types of dwellings in connection with 'older adults' in the journals indexed by Web of Science (WoS). In this article, we present a literature review of specialized housing solutions and other dwellings for older adults and further research agenda to develop optimization and control theory models supporting optimal planning, operations and control of services for older adults based on ambient intelligence, some of them based also on the geographic information technology and model to measure and forecast the demand for specialized housing stock and services in ageing society for which even the documents of the European Commission state that has not been developed yet. Industrial engineering and production research has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of supply networks for older adults and mitigate the rising expenditure for health care and long-term care in ageing societies.

We find that negative money supply shocks caused Spanish real output to decline. A transmission channel analysis highlights slow price adjustments and credit frictions as mechanisms through which money supply changes affected the real economy.

We compare the performance of gold and silver NPs in oligonucleotide sensors to determine if a change in metal will lead to either higher sensitivity or different selectivity, based on the redox behaviour of silver vs. gold. Surprisingly, we find that using either gold or silver NPs yields very similar overall performance. The electrochemical measurements of both types of sensors show the same redox behaviour which is dominated by the cobalt porphyrin, indicating that the electron pathway does not include the NP, but there is direct electron transfer between the porphyrin and the electrode. Both sensors show a linear response in the range of 5 x 10(-17)-1 x 10(-16) M; the limit of detection (LOD) is 3.8 x 10(-18) M for the AuNP sensor, and 5.0 x 10(-18)M for the AgNP sensor, respectively, which corresponds to the detection of about 20-50 DNA molecules in the analyte. Overall, the silver system results in a better DNA economy and using cheaper starting materials for the NPs, thus shows better cost-effectivness and could be more suitable for the mass-production of highly sensitive DNA sensors.

In the present work, we evaluated the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of silver nanoparticles produced by green synthesis with exopolysaccharides produced by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa UANL-001L, against pathogens of clinical importance. The extraction of exopolysaccharides produced by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was performed according to a previously described method. Synthesis of the nanobiocomposite was performed by mixing silver nitrate, Acacia rigidula, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa-produced exopolysaccharides. The newly synthesized nanobiocomposite was lyophilized and kept frozen for further analysis. The characterization of the nanobiocomposite was carried out by UV-visible spectroscopic, Fourier transform infrared analysis and the surface morphology was analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity was tested in 96-well plates for different concentrations of the nanobiocomposite against Escherichia. coli ATCC 11229, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The Rhodotorula mucilaginosa- produced exopolysaccharides were useful in the silver nanoparticle synthesis and the resulting nanobiocomposite had antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at lower concentrations than previously reported. Due to these properties, the nanobiocomposite seems to be a promising biocide against pathogens of clinical relevance. In addition, the nanobiocomposite proved to be advantageous in the formulation of hybrid metal-polymer coatings for medical devices or industrial settings.","[Vazquez-Rodriguez, Augusto; Vasto-Anzaldo, Ximena G.; Leon-Buitimea, A.; Zarate, Xristo; Ruben Morones-Ramirez, Jose] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, San Nicolas De Los Garza 66455, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Vazquez-Rodriguez, Augusto; Vasto-Anzaldo, Ximena G.; Leon-Buitimea, A.; Zarate, Xristo; Ruben Morones-Ramirez, Jose] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Invest Biotecnol & Nanotecnol, San Nicolas De Los Garza 66455, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Vazquez-Rodriguez, Augusto; Vasto-Anzaldo, Ximena G.; Leon-Buitimea, A.; Zarate, Xristo; Ruben Morones-Ramirez, Jose] Parque Invest & Innovac Tecnol, Apodaca 66629, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Morones-Ramírez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, San Nicolas De Los Garza 66455, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.",jose.moronesrmr@uanl.edu.mx,"LEÓN-BUITIMEA, ANGEL/X-4542-2019","Morones-Ramirez, Jose Ruben/0000-0001-7009-686X; Leon Buitimea, Angel/0000-0002-5686-4639",CONACyT,CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The authors would like to thank the laboratories and installations of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon and the School of Chemicals Sciences, where all the experiments in this manuscript were carried out, and to CONACyT for providing research scholarships to all the authors of this article.",,36,19,19,1,19,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1536-1241,1558-2639,,IEEE T NANOBIOSCI,IEEE Trans.

In the first part, silver powder was produced by solid state hydrogen reduction. The average particle size of the resulting silver powder falls within the range of 0.5 to 4.5 jm. Next, seven silver clays with different powder to binder ratios were made. Then, samples for testing were prepared from the commercially available silver clay. In the second part, tests of the samples were carried out. The susceptibility of clays to shaping, density, hardness and roughness were examined. A sample with 1% methylcellulose showed a roughness of less than 1 jm. The shrinkage value ranged from more than 30% to less than 5% for the highest and lowest methylcellulose clays, respectively. Tensile strength ranged from 90 to 100 MPa for samples with lower methylcellulose content in the clay and from 30 to 80 MPa for samples with higher methylcellulose content. The highest electrical conductivity was achieved for samples with the lowest content of methylcellulose, reaching almost 80% of the conductivity of bulk silver. The microstructure of the powders and the produced samples were tested. Recycling reactions of reactants have been postulated, to obtain sustainable production by-design. A holistic sustainability assessment is quantified using circular and green metrics as well as life cycle assessment. A material circularity indicator (MCI) of 0.50 and an E-factor of 0.29 were determined, generating environmentally relatively harmless water (84%) and green gases such as O2 and H2 (7%) as waste/by-products. The cost of producing 1 kg of silver powder utilizing the closed-loop technology presented in this paper amounts to euro1103.45.","[Chrapek, Barbara Jadwiga; Mroczkowski, Marcin; Palka, Pawel; Wasik, Anna; Malecki, Stanislaw; Wojtaszek, Konrad; Wojnicki, Marek] AGH Univ Krakow, Fac Nonferrous Met, Al A Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Escriba-Gelonch, Marc] Univ Lleida, Higher Polytech Engn Sch, Dept Chem, Igualada, Spain; [Hessel, Volker] Univ Warwick, Sch Engn, Warwick, England; [Hessel, Volker] Univ Adelaide, Sch Chem Engn, Adelaide, Australia; [Goodsite, Michael] Univ Adelaide, Inst Sustainabil Energy & Resources, Div Res & Innovat, Adelaide, Australia",AGH University of Krakow; Universitat de Lleida; University of Warwick; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Wojnicki, M (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Krakow, Fac Nonferrous Met, Al A Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",marekw@agh.edu.pl,"hessel, ellen/ABB-4007-2021; Goodsite, Michael/X-9374-2019; Escribà-Gelonch, Marc/B-5008-2015; Wojnicki, Marek/AGG-6932-2022; Goodsite, Michael/B-7321-2012; Palka, Pawel/Y-7360-2018","Wojtaszek, Konrad/0000-0003-4168-9281; Goodsite, Michael/0000-0002-4565-6607; Mroczkowski, Marcin/0000-0002-0870-6839; Malecki, Stanislaw/0000-0003-4905-5267; Wojnicki, Marek/0000-0002-1387-0000; Wasik, Anna/0000-0003-4880-0237; Palka, Pawel/0000-0003-0640-7939",AGH in Krakow from IDUB project [6438]; AGH in Krakow from IDUB project,AGH in Krakow from IDUB project; AGH in Krakow from IDUB project,This research was funded by AGH in Krakow from IDUB project nr. 6438,,66,0,0,7,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-9937,,,SUSTAIN MATER TECHNO,Sustain.

Silver recovery from wastewater and its valorization in the form of silver nanoflakes (AgNFs) brings back waste material to production stream and helps in transition from linear to circular economy. In the present study, bioelectrochemical performance of MFC fed with silver laden artificial wastewater (MFC-Ag) was compared with MFC fed with potassium ferricyanide (MFC-FC) and MFC fed with phosphate buffer as catholyte (MFC-blank). High silver removal (83 +/- 0.7%) and recovery (67.8 +/- 1%) efficiencies were achieved from MFC-Ag after 72 h operation. The maximum power density (3006 mW/m(3)) and current density (34100 mA/m(3)) of MFC-Ag were found to be significantly higher than the MFC-FC and MFC-blank. High chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of MFC-Ag (82.7 +/- 1.5%) compared with MFC-FC (76 +/- 2) highlighted the suitability of silver laden wastewater as a cost effective catholyte. The high coulombic efficiency (8.73 +/- 0.9%) and low solution resistance (24.38 Omega) for MFC-Ag also indicate the potential of silver laden wastewater for large scale applications. Analytical characterizations of electrochemically recovered silver revealed the pure (99%) and crystalline AgNFs with a mean diameter of 18 +/- 1.2 nm on the cathode surface. Furthermore, a significant anti-biofouling activity of recovered AgNFs indicate the valorization of waste by current study with potential applications in several industrial and environmental processes. Our method has diverse potential to scale up the MFC technology for industrial waste management as a closed loop process with minimum facilities and higher sustainability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The following review of the archeological and document evidence indicates that three events occurring in the first half of the first millennium BC trigger the emergence of a specialized and integrated classical economy after 500 BC: (i) growth in demand for silver as a medium of exchange in economies in the Near East; (ii) technical breakthroughs in hull construction and sailing rig in merchant shipping of the late Bronze Age; (iii) perfection of ferrous metallurgy into the European hinterland. This last event raised agricultural productivity to a level capable of supporting the occupational specialization needed to sustain a vigorous trading economy. To these initial causes may be added the diffusion of alphabetic writing. While it did not create opportunities for long-distance trade, the diffusion of writing supplied the means of responding on a scale large enough economically to matter.","[Grantham, George] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Grantham, G (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",George.grantham@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,179,0,0,1,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0265-0525,1471-6437,,SOC PHILOS POLICY,Soc.

This led to a large trade surplus accompanied by large inflows of silver money. The increase in the money supply did not have much effect on rice prices or consumption, but did lower interest rates. The lower interest rates and higher real money balances caused a large increase in real estate prices. This local financial glut lasted more than 20 years. Along the China coast, the banking system allowed businesses to move funds easily in and out of areas, such as northern Taiwan, but once silver reached Taiwanese farmers in the village economy, it did not flow so easily. Studies of early finance that focus on commercial networks generally overlook such problems.","[Olds, Kelly B.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Olds, KB (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",olds@ntu.edu.tw,"Olds, Kelly/Q-9603-2019",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C.

Functionalized heterocyclic products are built up from readily available linear amines through simple and reliable silver catalysis, representing a new silver-based C-H functionalization. This method displays preference for primary sp(3) C-H bonds and exhibits distinct chemo- and regioselectivity compared to existing methods of direct amination (Hofmann-Loffler-Freytag reaction and nitrene insertion).

The reaction is inherently modular, allowing for the incorporation of peripheral substituents at any site of the quinoline product. The reaction is readily applied to other heterocyles also as exemplified by the preparation of naphthyridines. Competition reactions to determine the reactivity of dissimilar alkynes demonstrated that the product ratio of dimerization vs intermolecular addition is rather dependent on the electronic nature of aryl substituent on the alkynes. However, control experiments with substrates possessing internal alkynes resulted in cycloisomerization instead of expected dimerization, which is indicative of possible steric influence of the alkyne terminus in the reaction outcome.","[Praveen, Chandrasekar] CSIR Cent Electrochem Res Inst, Funct Mat Div, Karaikkudi 630006, Tamil Nadu, India; [Perumal, P.

J,"Zimmer, Z",,,,"Zimmer, Zac",,,Bitcoin and Potosi Silver Historical Perspectives on Cryptocurrency,TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, has been celebrated as the future of money on the Internet. Although Bitcoin does present several forward-looking innovations, it also integrates a very, old concept into its digital architecture: the mining of precious metals. Even though Bitcoin explicitly invokes mining as a metaphor and gold as an example for understanding the cryptocurrency, there has been little critical work on the connections between Bitcoin and previous metalist currency regimes. The following essay proposes a historical comparison with colonial South American silver mining and the global currency regime based on the New World silver peso it created as a way to interrogate Bitcoin. The comparison with colonial South America, and specifically the silver mining economy around the Cerro Rico de Potosi, will help to develop a historical and political understanding of Bit coin's stakes, including questions of resources, labor, energy, and ecology. Mining and the extractive apparatus that accompanies it always imply massive-scale earthworks that reshape the planet itself, a process known as terraforming. The Potosi comparison will reveal Bitcoin to form part of a similar process of digital primitive accumulation we can provisionally name cryptoforming.

The anti-microbial activities of the catalysts are determined quantitatively by serial dilution followed by inoculation method. The catalytic characterization of these materials obtained by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). TEM and X-ray line broadening technique results indicate the presence of Ag particles in nanometer size. The main advantage of Ag supported catalysts prepared by electro-chemical deposition over that made by conventional impregnation technique is that only small amount is needed and no pretreatment conditions like reduction are required for deactivation of microorganism in water. Thus, silver catalysts prepared by this method are not only efficient but also economical in restoring hydrogen economy. The combined characteristics of Al2O3 and carbon like low acidity, high mechanical strength and presence of meso pores in CCA are also helpful for getting good activity.

With the rise of novel pathogenic viruses and resistance of the known ones to conventional drugs and medications, exploration of new materials with antiviral properties has become an expanding interest not just in the field of biomedicine but also in materials science, particularly in nanotechnology. The unique physicochemical properties of nanostructures derived from gold and silver, and metal oxides have attracted considerable attention as novel antiviral nanomaterials. In this paper, we review the antiviral potential of plasmonic gold and silver, and metal oxide nanostructures against known human pathogenic viruses such as herpes, hepatitis, dengue, influenza, measles, human immunodeficiency virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and other viruses. Experimental investigations revealed the promising potential of both plasmonic and metal oxide nanostructures as antiviral agents. The mechanisms of antiviral action were found to vary for different nanomaterials and its target virus while some mechanisms remained unclear. The promising yet undeterministic antiviral potential of these nanomaterials paved a more interesting platform for further research and biomedical exploration.","[Budlayan, Marco Laurence M.] Caraga State Univ, Mat Sci & Polymer Chem Lab, Butuan City, Philippines; [Budlayan, Marco Laurence M.] Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Phys, Quezon City, Philippines; [Patricio, Jonathan N.; Arco, Susan D.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Synthet Organ Chem Lab, Inst Chem, Quezon City, Philippines; [Patricio, Jonathan N.; Arco, Susan D.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Nat Sci Res Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Patricio, Jonathan N.; Arco, Susan D.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Mat Sci & Engn Program, Coll Sci, Quezon City, Philippines; [Capangpangan, Rey Y.] Caraga State Univ, Dept Chem, Mat Sci & Polymer Chem Lab, Ctr Nanosci & Technol Res & Entrepreneurship, Butuan City, Philippines",Ateneo de Manila University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Budlayan, MLM (通讯作者)，Caraga State Univ, Mat Sci & Polymer Chem Lab, Butuan City, Philippines.;Budlayan, MLM (通讯作者)，Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Phys, Quezon City, Philippines.",marcobudlayan@gmail.com; jnpatricio@up.edu.ph; sdarco@up.edu.ph; rycapangpangan@carsu.edu.ph,"Capangpangan, Rey/AAX-7641-2021; Patricio, Jonathan/NBY-5252-2025",,,,,,47,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-8506-4,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,02BA07,,,,,8,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,BS0HQ,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000682785900034,View Full Record in Web of Science

This explorative paper focuses on the present empirical situation and expectations of the workforce capacity of older persons in good mental and physical health: paid and unpaid active retirees in Germany (Silver Workers). The lifestyles of Silver Workers as well as reasons for engagement in post-retirement activities and necessary framework conditions of work during retirement are described.

The main question addressed is how the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank's (ECB's) announcements concerning monetary easing affect two major commodities: gold and silver. Our empirical evidence based on daily and high-frequency data suggests that relevant information causes ambiguous valuation adjustments as well as stabilization or destabilization effects. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the Japanese Central Bank strengthens the precious metal markets by increasing their returns and by causing stabilization effects, in contrast to the ECB, which has opposite results, mainly due to the heterogeneous expectations of investors within these markets. These asymmetries across central banks' effects on gold and silver risk-return profile imply that the ECB unconventional monetary easing informational content opposes its stated mission, adding uncertainty in precious metals markets.","[Papadamou, Stephanos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Volos, Greece; [Sogiakas, Vasilios] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Thessaly; University of Glasgow,"Sogiakas, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch Econ, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",vasilios.sogiakas@glasgow.ac.uk,"Sogiakas, Vasilios/AIE-3276-2022; Papadamou, Stephanos/I-2580-2019","Sogiakas, Vasilios/0000-0002-1641-6129; PAPADAMOU, STEPHANOS/0000-0002-7700-1912",,,,,39,13,13,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0277-6693,1099-131X,,J FORECASTING,J.

It was a matter of grave concern for the governments of all the countries as the deadly virus started expanding its paws over neighboring regions of infected areas. The spread got uncontrollable, thereby leaving no choice for the nations but to impose and observe nationwide lockdown. The lockdown further sorely hit many sectors, which in turn impacted the economy. Manufacturing, agriculture, and the service sector - the three pillars of the economy - have been adversely affected giving a major slow down to the economy belonging to every nation. Several schemes and policies were introduced by different state and central governments to absorb the impact of subsequent lockdowns on individuals. In this paper, we present a then and now analysis of the economy using a socioeconomic framework focusing on factors- unemployment, industrial production, import-export trade, equity markets, currency exchange rate, and gold and silver prices. For all these, we consider India as a case study because the Indian sub-continent has a wide landscape and rich cultural heritage presenting itself as a potential hub for economic activities. A thorough assessment has been made for the period January 2020- June 2020.

Since silver is not available locally in the Levant, its ongoing use as currency in the region triggered long-distance trade initiatives, and its availability or lack thereof had a direct impact on the economy. The continued use is evidenced in 40 silver hoards found in various sites across the region. A comprehensive study of lead isotopes and chemical analyses of samples obtained from 19 hoards enabled us to trace the origin of silver in the millennium during which it was extensively used as currency in the southern Levant and to identify constantly changing silver sources and concomitant trade routes. The results indicate that silver originated initially in Anatolia and Greece (similar to 1700/1650-1600 BC) and shortly after from an unknown location in the Aegean/Carpathian/Anatolian sphere (similar to 1600-1200 BC). After the collapse of Late Bronze Age Mediterranean trade routes, during Iron Age I (similar to 1200-950 BC), there was a period of shortage. Silver trade was revived by the Phoenicians, who brought silver to the Levant from Sardinia and Anatolia (similar to 950-900 BC), and later from Iberia (similar to 900-630 BC). Further change occurred after the Assyrian retreat from the Levant, when silver was shipped from the Aegean (similar to 630-600 BC). Following the devastation caused by the expanding Babylonian empire, silver consumption in the Levant practically ended for a century. Considering the isotopic results, combined with a detailed study of the context, chronology, and chemical composition, we demonstrate that all these factors are essential for the reconstruction of developments in the supply of silver in the southern Levant, and more generally. The changes in trade routes closely follow political and social transformations for over a millennium; exchange in this case was not only, not even mainly preconditioned by the environmental/geographic circumstances, as has often been argued for the Mediterranean. From an analytical point of view, we offer a protocol for the provenance of silver in general.","[Eshel, Tzilla; Gilboa, Ayelet] Univ Haifa, Zinman Inst Archaeol, POB 3338,99 Aba Khoushy Ave,Mt Carmel, IL-3103301 Haifa, Israel; [Eshel, Tzilla; Gilboa, Ayelet] Univ Haifa, Sch Archaeol & Maritime Cultures, POB 3338,99 Aba Khoushy Ave,Mt Carmel, IL-3103301 Haifa, Israel; [Erel, Yigal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Yahalom-Mack, Naama] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Archaeol, Mt Scopus, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",University of Haifa; University of Haifa; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Eshel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Zinman Inst Archaeol, POB 3338,99 Aba Khoushy Ave,Mt Carmel, IL-3103301 Haifa, Israel.;Eshel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Sch Archaeol & Maritime Cultures, POB 3338,99 Aba Khoushy Ave,Mt Carmel, IL-3103301 Haifa, Israel.",teshel@univ.haifa.ac.il,"Eshel, Tzilla/ITU-4040-2023",,Gerda-Henkel Foundation in Germany [AZ 05/F/16],Gerda-Henkel Foundation in Germany,"This research was supported by the Gerda-Henkel Foundation in Germany (Grant AZ 05/F/16; awarded to A.G. and Y.E.).

Based on macroscopic and microscopic observations, all experimental samples showed the presence of Gram-positive bacilli as well as mould fungi of the genus Rhizopus, Alternaria and Aspergillus. The study showed that the biocomponents containing silver nanoparticles obtained by using xylose as a reducing agent limit the development of microbial infection and stimulate the germination rate of tomato seeds.

Biomass-derived materials are highly desirable for the environment and energy-related applications, but raw biomass materials cannot satisfy cooling demands for more environment and energy-efficient processes. Herein, inspired by the transpiration of natural plants and radiation cooling of metal materials, this study presents the silver nanoparticles-coated wood with a coupled cooling effect for dual-mode cooling. The silver nanoparticles-coated wood with a natural hollow ordered pore structure can achieve the cooling effect by the capillary phenomenon where water absorption and evaporation. The results revealed that silver nanoparticles with high infrared reflectivity were firmly embedded in the surface of the wood by magnetron sputtering, which empowers the wood with high infrared heat dissipation properties. Compared to the bare porous wood, the surface temperatures of silver nanoparticles coated wood were decreased from 34.6-35.8 to 30.3-31.2 degrees C. In addition, by combining with the evaporative and radiative heat dissipation, the silver-coated wood obtained the coupled cooling effect under simulated solar radiation, which further improves the cooling effect. Owing to the silver coating, the material possesses an excellent antibacterial property which extends durability.

Many photovoltaic (PV) panels that were installed during this technological revolution, have accumulated as waste and even more are nearing their End-of-Life (EoL). Based on circular economy, a new hydrometallurgical process has been proposed for the management of the EoL PVs. This results in a chemical extract containing 0.7% w/w Ag, along with various other metals. This study investigates the MFC technology as an alternative method for valuable metal recovery from the chemical extract of PV panels. Moreover, metal recovery from the chemical extract is compared with the individual recoveries obtained using corresponding synthetic solutions. The results indicated that silver was completely recovered from the synthetic and the real chemical extract, with a rate of similar to 82 and similar to 32 mu mol/h, respectively. The difference is attributed to the simultaneous reduction of other heavy metals in amorphous compounds, hindering the silver reduction kinetics and leading to a gradual electrode passivation. Nevertheless, silver can be 100% retrieved from the chemical extract, with a purity of 68-96% w/w (average 86% w/w), in crystal (face center cube) structure, containing minor metal impurities.

Based on the phenomenon of brain gain, we examine whether overseas-returned executives (returnees) help emerging economies better cope with this multitasking. Drawing insights from a Chinese listed firm dataset for the period 2010-2020, this study provides significant observations regarding returnees' influence on firms' environmental performance. The findings show that hiring returnees makes firms greener for three main reasons. First, returnees enjoy favorable treatment provided by the worksite, and the mood of giving back makes them inclined toward low-pollution development. Second, returnees have more green skills. Third, returnees alleviate the principal-agent problem of firms in green development. There are also some extended findings from this study. As inferred from the firms' environmental performance, returnees' overseas study experience may be more important than pure overseas work experience. Additionally, firms that green up by hiring returnees are not biased by firm seniority. Finally, if returnees are viewed as a scarce resource, conditional talent wars will emerge among firms. These findings provide insight into how emerging economies can balance economic development with environmental protection.","[Chen, He; Zhu, Shujin] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yiding] Xiangtan Univ, Sch Business, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Xiangtan University,"Tang, YD (通讯作者)，Xiangtan Univ, Sch Business, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China.",yd_tang@163.com,"zhu, shujin/JAC-2691-2023; Tang, Yiding/AHA-0224-2022","Tang, Yiding/0000-0003-2084-9207","National Social Science Fund of China [22 ZD100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [72173040]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2024JJ6440]; Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province [CX20240028, CX20220423]",National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province,"The authors express thanks to the Chief Editor Professor Richard S.J.

The experimental part schematically shows the principle of resistance welding and brazing, and diagrams show variations of current and voltage drop in both workpieces during brazing as a function of time. An analysis of the brazed joint included assessment of joint quality and of the occurrence of pores or other imperfections at the cross section of the joint. At individual locations of the joint, a chemical composition was analysed with a scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM with an energy disperse X-ray analyser. The conclusions drawn indicate that the technology applied to joining of silver and copper in the electrotechnical industry is quite suitable, although costly.

This paper considers the establishment of the demonstration zones as a quasi-natural experiment. Utilizing panel data from 53 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2006 to 2020, a time-varying difference-in-difference model is applied to examine whether this ecological policy can promote the elevation of green development levels of the marine economy, aiming to achieve a harmonious balance between clear waters and green mountains and mountains of gold and silver. The results indicate that the establishment of the demonstration zones significantly enhances the level of green development of the marine economy. Technological innovation and industrial structure are identified as two crucial mechanisms influencing green development of the marine economy, both exhibiting positive mediating effects. The impact of the establishment of the demonstration zones on the promotion of green development of the marine economy is more pronounced in the East China coastal region and the Central-south coastal region compared to the North China and Northeast coastal regions. Additionally, this policy effectively stimulates green development of the marine economy in medium and small cities and non-resource-based cities.

First, we situate platform work historically, in the longue duree of paid work under capitalism. Secondly, we introduce a consideration of social structure into debates on union practices often framed in terms of agency. Building on Silver and the Webbs, we highlight the importance in platform work of associational power over structural power; legal enactment over collective bargaining; and geographical over workplace unionism. While mainly a theoretical article, we draw on empirical evidence from research into platform work over five years, comprising interviews, case study, observation and documentary analysis. We conclude that platform labour unrest and unionism bear marked similarities with 19th century forms rather than the 20th century models that often dominate industrial relations perspectives.

The aim of the present study is the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from the extracts of Nepeta sessilifolia Bunge and Salvia hydrangea DC. ex Benth. and their antibacterial activity was measured. Methods For this purpose, the flowering branch of N. sessilifolia and the flower of S. hydrangea were randomly collected from three places, respectively, from the rangelands of Aqdash Mountain and Biabe in Isfahan province, Iran in May 2021. After extracting aqueous extracts by hot method, silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the biological method. Green synthesized silver nanoparticles were analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, and FESEM-EDAX. The antibacterial effect was evaluated by diffusion method in agar and determination of minimum growth inhibitory and lethal concentration (MIC and MBC) by dilution method in liquid culture medium. Results Based on the results of UV-Vis spectroscopy, silver nanoparticles synthesized from N. sessilifolia and S. hydrangea had distinct absorption peaks at wavelengths of 407 to 424 nm and 414 to 415 nm, respectively. The crystalline nature of these synthetic silver nanoparticles was confirmed by XRD. FESEM analysis showed that the size of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles from N. sessilifolia and S. hydrangea extracts were 10-50 nm and 10-80 nm, respectively, and were cubic. The results of diffusion in agar showed that the largest diameter of the growth inhibition zone belonging to the synthetic silver nanoparticles from both extracts of N. sessilifolia (similar to 26.00 mm) and S. hydrangea (similar to 23.50 mm) was against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The most vigorous killing activity by synthetic silver nanoparticles from N. sessilifolia extract was against Klebsiella pneumoniae with a value of 250 mu g/mL, two times stronger than rifampin. Conclusion Therefore, the studied extracts can be suitable options for fast and safe green synthesis of silver nanoparticles effective against some bacterial strains. These synthetic silver nanoparticles can be used as possible options and have strong potential for the production of natural antibiotics.","[Ghavam, Mansureh] Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Nat Engn, Kashan, Iran",University Kashan,"Ghavam, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Nat Engn, Kashan, Iran.",mghavam@kashanu.ac.ir,,,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,,93,6,6,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-7671,,BMC COMPLEMENT MED,BMC Complement.

It thereby complements a literature that has thus far focused far more upon the (apparently unobstructed) imposition of austerity. In doing so, it uses two typically 'low-resistance' countries - Japan and the UK -as least-likely cases and finds that austerity is rarely uncontested. Using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, it highlights the 'causal recipes' sufficient for both (1) anti-austerity activity to have a significant impact on austerity proposals and (2) the smooth (unobstructed) imposition of austerity. The politics of austerity is shown to be better understood as an iterative interaction between proposals for austerity and the acts of refusal they encounter. These obstacles to austerity appear more straightforward to activate effectively in Japan's coordinated model of capitalism, whilst the UK's liberal market economy tends to generate more innovative forms of dissent that (if they are sufficiently militant) provide an alternative route towards the obstruction of austerity.","[Bailey, David J.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Shibata, Saori] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands",University of Birmingham; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Bailey, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",d.j.bailey@bham.ac.uk; s.shibata@hum.leidenuniv.nl,"Shibata, Saori/HPH-0001-2023","Shibata, Saori/0000-0002-5944-9721",,,,,87,12,13,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0007-1234,1469-2112,,BRIT J POLIT SCI,Br.

The importance of indium has seen recent growth, and for technological reasons, these metals can be found in industrial residues from primary zinc production, such as the iron precipitate-jarosite. To secure the supply of such metals in Europe, and with the idea of a circular economy and the sustainable use of raw materials, the recycling of such industrial residues is coming into focus. Due to the low value of jarosite, the focus must lie simultaneously on the recovery of valuable metals and the production of high-quality products in order to pursue an economical process. The objective of this article is to give the fundamentals for the development of a successful process to extract the minor elements from roasted jarosite. As such, we use thermodynamic calculations to show the behavior of indium and silver, leading to a recommendation for the required conditions for a successful extraction process. In summary, the formation of chlorine compounds shows high potential to meet the challenge of simultaneously recovering these metals together with zinc at the lowest possible energy input.","[Steinlechner, Stefan; Antrekowitsch, Juergen] Univ Leoben, Chair Nonferrous Met, A-8700 Leoben, Austria",University of Leoben,"Steinlechner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leoben, Chair Nonferrous Met, A-8700 Leoben, Austria.",stefan.steinlechner@unileoben.ac.at; juergen.antrekowitsch@unileoben.ac.at,"Steinlechner, Stefan/S-1032-2019","Steinlechner, Stefan/0000-0001-6601-8471","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (BMWFW) [844725]","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (BMWFW)","The authors want to thank the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (BMWFW) for the financial support of this research activity (FFG project number: 844725).",,14,17,20,3,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2075-4701,,,METALS-BASEL,Metals,MAY,2018,8,5,,,,,,,335,10.3390/met8050335,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met8050335,,,9,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,GJ2NZ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000435109300045,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to promote its reliable application in deep space exploration considering the porous microstructural evolution and its effect on macroscopic performance, simulation analysis based on the reconstruction of pressureless sintered micron silver joints was carried out. In this paper, the deep space environment was achieved by a test of 250 extreme thermal shocks of 170 degrees C-125 degrees C, and the microstructural evolution was observed by using SEM. Taking advantage of the morphology autocorrelation function, three-dimensional models of the random-distribution medium consistent with SEM images were reconstructed, and utilized in further Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of material effective elastic modulus through a transfer procedure. Compared with test results and two analytical models, the good consistency of the prediction results proves that the proposed method is reliable. Through analyzing the change in autocorrelation functions, the microstructural evolution with increasing shocks was quantitively characterized. Mechanical response characteristics in FEA were discussed.

In this work, we demonstrated a modified photochemical approach for the preparation of carbon nanotubes-silver nanoparticles (CNTs-Ag) and graphene oxide-silver nanoparticles (GO-Ag) nanocomposites, which can be stably dispersible in aqueous solution. The formation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) on the functionalized CNTs and GO nanosheets was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV-Vis measurements. These analyses indicated that the average particle sizes of Ag-NPs deposited on GO/CNTs nanostructures were similar to 6-7 nm with nearly uniform size distribution. Moreover, these nanocomposites were found to exhibit enhanced antibacterial activity against two strains of infectious bacteria including Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria as compared to bare Ag-NPs.

DEO conversions achieved with the catalyst are 80-100%. 100% EGly or 97% ADA selectivity was produced by simply tuning reaction temperatures. The single-atom silver-manganese nanocatalysts were formed through the entrance of Ag atoms into the lattice tunnels of hollandite-type manganese oxide (HMO) under H-2 reduction at 200 degrees C. The excellent activities of the nanocatalysts are mainly ascribed to the activation of H-2 and desirable chemical adsorption of DEO and ethanol. The EGIy was formed through the first order hydrogenation of DEO, while the ADA was obtained via the hydrogenation, dehydration and reaction.

The growth of population and urbanization along with poor water supply and environmental hygiene are the main reasons for the increase in outbreak of infectious pathogens. Transmission of infectious pathogens to the community has caused outbreaks of diseases such as influenza (A/H5N1), diarrhea (Escherichia coli), cholera (Vibrio cholera), etc throughout the world. The comprehensive treatments of environments containing infectious pathogens using advanced disinfectant nanomaterials have been proposed for prevention of the outbreaks. Among these nanomaterials, silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) with unique properties of high antimicrobial activity have attracted much interest from scientists and technologists to develop nanosilver-based disinfectant products. This article aims to review the synthesis routes and antimicrobial effects of Ag-NPs against various pathogens including bacteria, fungi and virus.

Due to the complex nature of most ores, leaching processes are slow and have a low efficiency in noble metal extraction, which is usually improved by fine-milling the mineral. In this manuscript, we consider this strategy, demonstrating that it may increase the amount of silver leaching, but at the expense of a higher consumption of cyanide, which renders the process inefficient (only 2 % of consumed cyanide is employed to complex silver). The increase in the yield of the desired product without the smarter use of dangerous compounds is shown as a paradigm of the need to insert green chemistry principles in industrial processes. We further present the result of two potential strategies for greener mineral processing: the use of ultrasound to eliminate passivating layers formed during the leaching process and the use of chemical pretreatments to eliminate possible sources of passivation. These strategies can increase the amount of silver extraction and simultaneously increase the efficiency in cyanide consumption. The convenience of these pretreatments in the framework of the green chemistry principles, as well as the challenges towards their implementation at industrial scale, is discussed.","[Alarcon, Alejandro; Segura, Carlos; Gamarra, Carlos; Rodriguez-Reyes, Juan Carlos F.] Univ Ingn & Tecnol UTEC, Dept Bioengn & Chem Engn, Jr Medrano Silva 165, Lima 04, Peru",University of Engineering & Technology - UTEC,"Rodriguez-Reyes, JCF (通讯作者)，Univ Ingn & Tecnol UTEC, Dept Bioengn & Chem Engn, Jr Medrano Silva 165, Lima 04, Peru.",jcrodriguez@utec.edu.pe,"Segura, Angela/HZI-7199-2023; Rodriguez-Reyes, Juan Carlos F/R-7612-2018","Rodriguez-Reyes, Juan Carlos F/0000-0003-2271-4613; Gamarra Guere, Carlos Dante/0000-0002-3483-8640","Phosagro/UNESCO/IUPAC Partnership in Green Chemistry for Life [4500245048]; Perus National Council for Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CienciActiva-CONCYTEC); British Embassy in Lima [154-2015, 002-2016]","Phosagro/UNESCO/IUPAC Partnership in Green Chemistry for Life; Perus National Council for Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CienciActiva-CONCYTEC); British Embassy in Lima","This research was supported by the Phosagro/UNESCO/IUPAC Partnership in Green Chemistry for Life (Contract 4500245048) and by Perus National Council for Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CienciActiva-CONCYTEC) and the British Embassy in Lima (contracts 154-2015 and 002-2016).",,18,5,5,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0033-4545,1365-3075,,PURE APPL CHEM,Pure Appl.

The basis for calculating the amount taken by the state and the way it administered manufacture are not well understood. Here we analyze the weights of 1344 of the earliest coins of Athens (c. 550-479 BCE). We reveal a parabolic relationship between the cost of the silver and the weights of the coins whereby a progressively higher proportion was taken as the denomination decreased, meaning that the smaller the coin, the larger was the proportion of silver taken from it. There was tight control of the minting process and mathematical sophistication in precisely adjusting the silver content from the first introduction of coinage. It also made minting a profitable business. Changes in minting practice can be detected with the introduction of the Athenian owl coins, when the percentage of silver taken by the state increased and the spread of weights widened to include coins weighing more than the nominal weight. The latter indicates a significant shift toward monetization of the economy.","[Davis, Gillan] Ancient Hist Australian Catholic Univ, North Sydney Campus, North Sydney, Australia; [Albarede, Francis] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Geol Lyon, Paris, France",Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Davis, G (通讯作者)，Ancient Hist Australian Catholic Univ, North Sydney Campus, North Sydney, Australia.",gil.davis@acu.edu.au,"Albarede, Francis/A-8871-2011; Davis, Gillan/HNP-7826-2023","Davis, Gillan/0000-0001-9436-5024","This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant, No. 741454, Silver Isotopes and the Rise of Money and an earlier Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project DP 120103519, A spring of silver, a treasury in the earth: coinag [741454]; European Research Council Advanced Grant; Rise of Money [DP 120103519]; earlier Australian Research Council (ARC); Wiley - Australian Catholic University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians; European Research Council (ERC) [741454] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant, No. 741454, Silver Isotopes and the Rise of Money and an earlier Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project DP 120103519, A spring of silver, a treasury in the earth: coinag; European Research Council Advanced Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Rise of Money; earlier Australian Research Council (ARC); Wiley - Australian Catholic University agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","This work was supported by a European Research Council Advanced Grant, No. 741454, Silver Isotopes and the Rise of Money and an earlier Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project DP 120103519, A spring of silver, a treasury in the earth: coinage and wealth in archaic Athens.

The practice of direct discharge of septic tank effluents into the surrounding environment in the absence of proper treatment has increased health risks. In order to reduce this problem, a post-treatment unit consisting of nano-silver coated granular activated carbon (NS-GAC) has been developed. The study results revealed that the inactivation efficiency of the NS-GAC unit increased with increasing hydraulic retention times (HRT) from 10, 20 and 30 minutes; however, for economy of scale, the NS-GAC unit could be operated at the 10 minutes HRT to achieve complete removal of Escherichia coli bacteria.

On the demand side, our empirical results indicate that a boost to private investment can arrest a growth deceleration during a down-cycle, via consumption and output channels. We also observe that both the quantum and quality of public expenditure play an important role in arresting the growth deceleration. On the supply side, however, global supply chain disruptions could dampen the pace of investment during the post-COVID investment-led recovery. For both channels to work, credit offtake is necessary for a bank-dominated EME like India.

Campania's strategy for digitalization of health and care and for healthy aging is based on a person-centered, life-course, One Health approach, where demographic change is considered capable of stimulating a growth dynamic linked to the opportunities of combining the Silver Economy with local assets and the specific health needs of the population. The end-users (citizens, patients, and professionals) contribute to the co-creation of products and services, being involved in the identification of unmet needs and test-bed activity. The Campania Reference Site of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Aging is a flexible regional ecosystem to address the challenge of an aging population with a life-course approach. The good practices, developed in the context of research and innovation projects and innovative procurements by local stakeholders and collaborations with international networks, have been allowing the transfer of innovative solutions, knowledge, and skills to the stakeholders of such a multi-sectoral ecosystem for health.","[De Luca, Vincenzo; Bracale, Umberto Marcello; Triassi, Maria; Illario, Maddalena] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl, Naples, Italy; [Tramontano, Giovanni] Azienda Osped Univ Federico II, Unita Operat Semplice Ric & Sviluppo, Naples, Italy; [Riccio, Luigi; Trama, Ugo; Buono, Pietro] Direz Generale Tutela Salute & Coordinamento Serv, Naples, Italy; [Losasso, Mario] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Architettura, Naples, Italy; [Annuzzi, Giovanni] Azienda Osped Univ Federico II, Unita Operat Semplice Microinfusori & Tecnol Inno, Naples, Italy; [Zampetti, Rosa] Azienda Sanitaria Locale Salerno, Salerno, Italy; [Cacciatore, Francesco] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Med Traslaz, Naples, Italy; [Vallefuoco, Giannamaria] Azienda Sanitaria Locale Napoli 2 Nord, Frattamaggiore, Italy; [Lombardi, Alberto] Azienda Sanitaria Locale Benevento, Benevento, Italy; [Marro, Anna] Azienda Sanitaria Locale Avellino, Avellino, Italy; [Melone, Mariarosa Anna Beatrice] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Sci Med & Chirurg Avanzate, Naples, Italy; [Melone, Mariarosa Anna Beatrice] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Ctr Interuniv Ric Neurosci, Naples, Italy; [Ponsiglione, Cristina] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Ind, Naples, Italy; [Chiusano, Maria Luisa] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Naples, Italy; [Bracale, Giancarlo] Mediterranean Federat Adv Vasc Surg, Naples, Italy; [Cafiero, Gaetano] Unione Ind Napoli, Naples, Italy; [Crudeli, Aurelio] Federterme, Rome, Italy; [Vecchione, Carmine] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Med Chirurg & Odontoiatria, Salerno, Italy; [Taglialatela, Maurizio] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Neurosci & Sci Riprodutt & Odontosto, Naples, Italy; [Tramontano, Donatella] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Med Mol & Biotecnol Med, Naples, Italy; [Iaccarino, Guido] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Biomed Avanzate, Naples, Italy; [Roller-Wirnsberger, Regina] Med Univ Graz, Dept Internal Med, Graz, Austria; [Bousquet, Jean] Fdn Partenariale FMC VIA LR, MACVIA France, Montpellier, France",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Salerno; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II; Medical University of Graz; Universite de Montpellier,"Illario, M (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sanita Pubbl, Naples, Italy.",illario@unina.it,"Bousquet, Jean/O-4221-2019; De Luca, Vincenzo/AAC-8762-2022; BRACALE, Umberto/AAH-8291-2021; Francesco, Cacciatore/ABC-5486-2020; Vecchione, Carmine/K-2175-2018; Taglialatela, Maurizio/AAB-8621-2022; Ponsiglione, Cristina/AFP-2237-2022; Chiusano, Maria Luisa/AAQ-3064-2021; Melone, Mariarosa AB/N-6788-2015","Ponsiglione, Cristina/0000-0002-8953-5911; Bousquet, Jean/0000-0002-4061-4766; Chiusano, Maria Luisa/0000-0002-6296-7132; Vecchione, Carmine/0000-0002-2473-4565; De Luca, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6115-931X; Melone, Mariarosa AB/0000-0002-7213-9277",,,,,58,7,7,5,54,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

Herein, we show an efficient photocatalytic assembly formed by coupling formate dehydrogenase from Clostridium ljungdahliia (ClFDH), silver nanoclusters (AgNCs), TiO2, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The resulting integrated system is stable and can convert CO2 into formate with a turnover frequency of 1 s-1 and a turnover number of over 10,000 in 4 h. We highlight the key roles AgNCs have played to achieve such durability and high efficiency, which include (1) increasing the overall loading of biocatalysts and optimizing the orientation of enzyme molecules upon semiconductors by the Ag-cysteine interaction; (2) as the electron mediator, facilitating the interfacial electron transfer; and (3) scavenging the enzyme-deactivating reactive oxygen species.

Silver-based alloys were also largely used everyday as monetary currency and form of saving playing a relevant role for the development and growth of the economy. By means of the combined use of complementary surface analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM + EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy (OM) we have investigated the micro- and nano-chemical nature of the products of corrosion naturally formed on archaeological silver-based Roman objects characterised by different burial conditions. The results allow the identification of different corrosion products formed during the long interaction between the elements constituting the alloy, i.e. Ag and Cu, and degradation agents present in the surrounding environment. The results of the integrated analytical methodologies highlight the role of chlorine, that is always present in the patina as chloroargyrite (AgCl, also known as cerargyrite or horn silver) and also in some cases of bromine which forms bromargyrite (AgBr) or bromian-chloroargyrite [Ag(Br,Cl)] as dominant corrosion products. The unusual presence of Br in the silver patina reflects the peculiar environmental chemistry suffered by the buried object likely due to the presence of degrading organic matter under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, the results reveal that chlorine often preferentially corrodes the numerous local copper enrichments randomly dispersed in the silver host matrix inducing the formation of harmful copper-chlorine compounds including Cu2Cl(OH)(3) (atacamite and its polymorphs) and likely CuCl (nantokite) generally related to the copper cyclic corrosion called by conservators bronze disease. Finally, different corrosion patterns have been observed with the outermost layers often enriched by soil elements as S, Ca, Al, Si and Fe thus confirming the strong interaction of the alloys elements with the burial soil components.

According to the sustainability principles, coffee silver skin before its use was washed with water, lowering the associated costs and the whole environmental impact. The proposed adsorbent was characterized by adopting synergistically ATR-FTIR, SEM, and TG techniques, inferring its main features before and after the pollutant removal. Specifically, the presence of the latter in water was monitored by using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Several experimental conditions were explored during the adsorption, and the roles of ionic strength, pH, adsorbent/pollutant amounts, and temperature were investigated. The thermodynamics, adsorption isotherms, and kinetics were also studied, revealing that the process was spontaneous and occurred on heterogeneous skin surfaces forming a pollutant multilayer, joining a maximum adsorption capacity of 50 mgxg(-1). Interestingly, the pH values and ionic strength strongly affected the process, denoting the main presence of reversible electrostatic interaction between the pollutant and coffee silver skin. Indeed, the recycling of the proposed adsorbent was demonstrated by adopting safe and green conditions of work in the presence of diluted salt solutions or water at 50 degrees C, also recovering the pollutant. So, this paper has the aim to present, for the first time, the kinetics and thermodynamics of an adsorption process referred to the removal of an emerging pollutant from water by using coffee silver skin, avoiding hard working conditions to pre-treat the material before its use, thus proposing an alternative way to reuse this by-product as recyclable adsorbent.","[Gubitosa, Jennifer; Cignolo, Domenico; Rizzi, Vito; Cosma, Pinalysa] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Chem, Via Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Gubitosa, Jennifer] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, NANOTEC Ist Nanotecnol, Dipartimento Chim, Sede Secondaria Bari Co,CNR, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Rizzi, Vito; Fini, Paola; Nuzzo, Sergio; Cosma, Pinalysa] UOS Bari, Natl Res Council CNR, IPCF, Via Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Petrella, Andrea] Polytech Univ Bari, Dept Civil Environm Land Construct & Chem, I-70125 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Nanotecnologia (NANOTEC-CNR); Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i Processi Chimico-Fisici (IPCF-CNR); Politecnico di Bari,"Gubitosa, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Chem, Via Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",jennifer.gubitosa@uniba.it,"Rizzi, Vito/H-9027-2018; gubitosa, jennifer/AAT-3061-2021",,PRIN; European Union Next-GenerationEU [PE00000004],"PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); European Union Next-GenerationEU(European Union (EU))","This work was supported by the following projects: PRIN 2022 con il finanziamento del Ministero dell'Universita ` e della Ricerca nell'ambito del Bando relativo allo scorrimento delle gradu-atorie finali del bando PRIN 2022 entitled: From wastes to gold nanoparticles: CHemistRY for Sustainable And Low environmental Impact bio-circular Strategies in cancer therapy (CHRY.S.A.L.I.S.) ; PRIN2022-PNNR, Finanziato dall'Unione europea - Next Generation EU entitled Bioderived and atomic scale engineered natural adsor-bents: from water remediation to hydrogen evolution (BECOMEH2) ; MICS (Made in Italy - Circular and Sustainable) Extended Partnership and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) -MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.3-D.D. 1551.11-10-2022, PE00000004) ; PRIN2022 New crosslinked cyclodextrin-based MOFs for the removal of Emerging Contaminants.

The process comprises four sequential leaching stages; the first two based on HCl, correspond to base metals (e.g. Sn, Cu) removal, while the third is based on HNO3 for Ag leaching and the final on aqua regia for Au leaching. After base metals leaching, the solid residue, enriched in silver and gold about 5 times, contained silver almost quantitively as insoluble AgCl and significant losses (Ag loss <8%) were avoided. The necessary reduction of Ag in the solid phase was achieved with a solution of 0.5 M N2H4 and 3 M NaOH, at 80 C and S/L ratio 10%. Leaching of silver by 4 M HNO3 was followed by its recovery from nitrate solution by 0.08 \M N2H4 at ambient temperature with an efficiency of 83%. Gold was leached by aqua regia and quantitively recovered by 0.13 M N2H4 at ambient temperature. Wastewater resulting from the process, rich in nitrate (5 g/L) and chloride (50 g/L), was treated by an effective and novel biological denitrification system tolerating metals at ppm level, to comply with zero nitrate and residual metals discharge guidelines. The overall process requires low reagents and energy input and has zero discharge for liquid effluents. The scheme is appropriate to be applied at local small to medium industrial units, complying with decentralized circular economy principles for metal recovery from electronic waste.","[Vlasopoulos, Dimitrios; Mendrinou, Panagiota; Oustadakis, Paschalis; Kousi, Pavlina; Hatzikioseyian, Artin; Tsakiridis, Petros E.; Remoundaki, Emmanouella; Agatzini-Leonardou, Styliani] Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Heroon Polytech 9, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Stergiou, Athanasios; Karamoutsos, Spyridon-Dionysios] Thessi Agios Georgios, Ecoreset SA, Aspropyrgos 19300, Greece",,"Remoundaki, E (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Heroon Polytech 9, Zografos 15780, Greece.",astergiou@ecoreset.gr; sdkaramoutsos@ecoreset.gr; remound@metal.ntua.gr,"Kousi, Pavlina/AAQ-6867-2020; Χατζηκιοσεγιάν, Αρτίν/KEI-3337-2024; Remoundaki, Emmanouela/E-4970-2010; Oustadakis, Paschalis/JAZ-9883-2023; Tsakiridis, Petros/AAH-6232-2019","VLASOPOULOS, DIMITRIOS/0000-0002-1578-4237; Kousi, Pavlina/0000-0001-9446-3142; Tsakiridis, Petros/0000-0002-2180-2454; Remoundaki, Emmanouella/0000-0002-5858-4796; Hatzikioseyian, Artin/0000-0002-7638-6291; Oustadakis, Paschalis/0000-0003-2693-1965; Mendrinou, Panagiota/0000-0003-2052-8761","European Regional Development Fund of the European Union; Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation [T1EDK-00219]; State Scholarships Foundation of Greece (IKY); European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning","European Regional Development Fund of the European Union(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation; State Scholarships Foundation of Greece (IKY); European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning","This research has been co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE (project code: T1EDK-00219) .

J,"Doyle, P",,,,"Doyle, Patrick",,,"The Irish Land Question, the International Monetary Problem, and Archbishop William Walsh, 1881-1896",HISTORICAL JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article explores the significance to the Irish land question of a controversial issue in late nineteenth-century international political economy - bimetallism. Bimetallists advocated a monetary system that used gold and silver to define currency value rather than gold alone. Archbishop William Walsh's support for bimetallism is analysed to highlight how Ireland provided a case-study that framed this debate. Walsh believed the gold standard deepened an agrarian crisis that drove the Irish land question. He argued that careful and internationally orchestrated reform of the monetary system offered the means for its resolution. Walsh's bimetallist views marked him out as an original thinker within Irish nationalism, and his views were debated and adopted by monetary reformers across Britain, Europe, and the United States where they featured during the 1896 Presidential Election. Walsh's engagement in monetary politics must also be understood within a tradition of Catholic social teaching in which he positioned himself as a critic of financial capitalism. This article contextualizes the Irish land question within wider debates on the role of silver in the global economy and argues that Walsh's monetary thought reveals him to be a more significant international intellectual than his involvement in Irish politics tends to allow.","[Doyle, Patrick] Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Doyle, P (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Limerick, Ireland.",patrick.doyle@ul.ie,,"Doyle, Patrick John/0000-0002-3538-2585",Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester,Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester,"I would like to gratefully acknowledge the support given to this research by the Hallsworth Research Fellowship at the University of Manchester, which I held from 2017 to 2020.",,91,1,1,1,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0018-246X,1469-5103,,HIST J,Hist.

The adoption of solar reflective coatings for opaque surfaces of the vehicle shell can decrease the soak temperature of the air in the cabin of a vehicle parked in the sun, potentially reducing the vehicle's ancillary load and improving its fuel economy by permitting the use of a smaller air conditioner. An experimental comparison of otherwise identical black and silver compact sedans indicated that increasing the solar reflectance (rho) of the car's shell by about 0.5 lowered the soak temperature of breath-level air by about 5-6 degrees C. Thermal analysis predicts that the air conditioning capacity required to cool the cabin air in the silver car to 25 degrees C within 30 min is 13% less than that required in the black car. Assuming that potential reductions in AC capacity and engine ancillary load scale linearly with increase in shell solar reflectance, ADVISOR simulations of the SC03 driving cycle indicate that substituting a typical cool-colored shell (rho = 0.35) for a black shell (rho = 0.05) would reduce fuel consumption by 0.12 L per 100 km (1.1%), increasing fuel economy by 0.10 km L-1 [0.24 mpg] (1.1%). It would also decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2.7 g km(-1) (1.1%), nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 5.4 mg km(-1) (0.44%), carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 17 mg km(-1) (0.43%), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions by 4.1 mg km(-1) (0.37%). Selecting a typical white or silver shell (rho = 0.60) instead of a black shell would lower fuel consumption by 0.21 L per 100 km (1.9%), raising fuel economy by 0.19 km L-1 [0.44 mpg] (2.0%). It would also decrease CO2 emissions by 4.9 g km(-1) (1.9%), NOx emissions by 9.9 mg km(-1) (0.80%), CO emissions by 31 mg km(-1) (0.79%), and HC emissions by 7.4 mg km(-1) (0.67%). Our simulations may underestimate emission reductions because emissions in standardized driving cycles are typically lower than those in real-world driving. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this research are to define significant sources of environmental impact throughout a large jewelry manufacturing value chain, and to understand the consequences of using materials from different sources in order to identify potential solutions towards green industry. Feasible solutions to environmental impact reduction regarding material sourcing, energy consumption and waste treatment are recommended based on the comparison of the results. An environmental assessment is conducted following a life cycle assessment framework provided in ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006. The assessment focuses on the impacts of environmental interventions from the value chain associated with the company operations in 2013. All in all one business-as-usual, ten alternative and nine sensitivity scenarios are developed to assess the impacts from the company's operations in 2013, to determine potential impact reductions from feasible solutions and to investigate the robustness of the results. The representative data for manufacturing stage were primarily gathered from the company while the data for other stages are secondary data. Gold and silver mining and refining is the largest contributor from the overall supply chain for all impact categories considered. Using recycled gold and silver is the most effective solution to decrease life cycle negative impacts. The use of gold and silver recycled from high-value industries (i.e. jewelry production) produces less adverse impacts compared to gold and silver recycled from end-of-life electronic waste. According to the statistical data, gold and silver mining and refining could be the suppliers capable of supplying gold and silver because of the market constraints of recycled gold and silver. Green mining operations are introduced as alternatives to reduce impact directly generated from mining operations. For manufacturing, electricity consumption reduction shows a potential impact reduction. Using recycled gold and silver is recommended for jewelry manufacturers who plan to reduce environmental impacts. Using gold and silver from green mining is also recommended when the use of gold and silver from mining is necessary. Reducing electricity consumption in manufacturing is also one option for the company since it could be activated directly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Sugg, B",,,,"Sugg, Bethany",,,Circular textiles innovation during COVID-19: not the silver lining some had hoped for,JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Circular economy; Sustainable; Fashion; Textile; Innovation; Supply chain; COVID-19; Pandemic; Serial interviews,SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODELS; SUPPLY CHAIN; ECONOMY; DRIVERS; LEVEL,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has caused irrefutable devastation globally. Yet, academic and trade commentators have claimed that this disruption could have had a silver lining by presenting the fashion industry with the opportunity to reassess and rebuild in a slower, more considered way. Part of this reassessment, some have argued, may have been allowing the industry's pre-COVID sustainability buzz to come to fruition by nudging the fashion industry to go circular. This paper explores if, and how, the COVID-19 pandemic was (not) nudging the industry towards circularity using the case study of circular textiles. Design/methodology/approach Serial, semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with three buyers and sourcers working for three UK-based fashion retailers. Each participant was involved in three interviews in June 2020 following the UK's first national lockdown. Findings The research findings suggest that, at the time this research was undertaken, these retailers were focussed on regaining profit, protecting their supply chains and producing safe designs whilst cutting back and becoming more risk averse. These actors suggested that, in contrast to the suppositions made by academic and media commentators, the COVID-19 pandemic was acting as a hindrance to circularity, not a helping hand, as retailers were less willing to invest in circular textiles at that time than they were pre-pandemic. Originality/value This paper offers valuable insight into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on circular innovation within fashion retail whilst contributing to broader understandings of the principles of the circular economy within textiles and design.","[Sugg, Bethany] Univ Bristol, Sch Management, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Sugg, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Management, Bristol, Avon, England.",bethany.sugg@bristol.ac.uk,,"Sugg, Bethany/0000-0002-2785-4909",,,,,53,3,3,3,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1361-2026,1758-7433,,J FASH MARK MANAG,J.

The project objectives were achieved by investigating economically viable, and critical or strategic minerals remaining in South Africa, as well as resource scarcity, as a driver for South Africa to transition to a circular economy. The study found that some minerals in South Africa, such as iron ore, lead, manganese, gold, and cobalt have less than 50 years of economically viable mining remaining. At least 18 minerals can be classified indicatively as critical or strategic: aggregates, bauxite, chromite, cobalt, copper, gold, graphite, iron, limestone, lithium, manganese, nickel, phosphorous, platinum group metals, rare earth elements, silver, titanium, and vanadium. The classification was based on the minerals' economic importance, supply risk, and potential use in the development and manufacturing of emerging technologies. The findings suggest that the scarcity of mineral resources is a critical driver for the country to transition to a circular economy. Other identified drivers include socio-economic factors, climate change commitments, and business objectives. All minerals are non-renewable resources and at risk of depletion, therefore sustainable extraction and use are critical. Priority should be directed at investigating circular economy opportunities and substitutes for commodities at risk of being depleted within the next 50 years. There is an opportunity for South Africa to transition from a minerals export-based model to one that promotes local mineral beneficiation and manufacturing of end products.","[Khan, S.; Maphalala, B.; Nontso, Z.; Godfrey, L.] Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Magweregwede, F.] Mine Hlth & Safety Council MHSC, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Khan, S (通讯作者)，Council Sci & Ind Res CSIR, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",SKhan2@csir.co.za,,,Department of Science and Innovation,Department of Science and Innovation,"We would like to thank the Department of Science and Innovation for funding this project, through the Waste Research Development and Innovation (RDI) Roadmap Implementation Unit hosted by the CSIR.

Utilizing theoretical insights from the model of slaving zones, the essay examines recorded incidents of human trafficking along China's littoral from 1370 to 1565 and contends that its presence and persistence were intertwined with the Ming court's economic policies and problems. Here the history of human trafficking in early-to-mid-Ming China is viewed from the perspective of a series of challenges to the country's economic well-being but also to its power to govern according to its own laws and norms. These challenges include the Ming regime's efforts: to eradicate piracy and smuggling through their integration into the lawful framework of tribute trade; to support provincial requests for extra revenue to promote military security; to acquire Japanese silver but deny Japan mercantile access to China; to profit from Portugal's Southeast Asian and Japanese commercial networks. This study argues that the increasing prevalence of human trafficking along China's coastline was the result of competing forces anxious for power and riches that fused into the thrust of sixteenth-century China's expanding economy, as well as the adaptability of those in authority to ignore the consequences of allowing safe havens for persons bartering and selling human beings. These factors turned the status of Ming China's littoral from a no slaving zone into an imperfect no slaving zone.","[Zurndorfer, Harriet] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Zurndorfer, H (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",h.zurndorfer@kpnplanet.nl,,,I am grateful to the CSSH reviewers for their helpful and stimulating suggestions which guided me to make a number of important revisions.,I am grateful to the CSSH reviewers for their helpful and stimulating suggestions which guided me to make a number of important revisions.,I am grateful to the CSSH reviewers for their helpful and stimulating suggestions which guided me to make a number of important revisions.,,122,2,3,4,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0010-4175,1475-2999,,COMP STUD SOC HIST,Comp.

The results demonstrate that over 2000 ago important advances in the technology of thin layer deposition on metal substrates were attained by Romans. The ancient metallurgists produced counterfeited coins by combining sophisticated microplating methods and tailored surface chemical modification based on the mercury-silvering process. The results reveal that Romans were able systematically to chemically and metallurgically manipulate alloys at a micro scale to produce adherent precious metal layers with a uniform thickness up to few micrometers. The results converge to reveal that the production of forgeries was aimed firstly to save expensive metals as much as possible allowing profitable large-scale production at a lower cost. The driving forces could have been a lack of precious metals, an unexpected need to circulate coins for trade and/or a combinations of social, political and economic factors that requested a change in money supply. Finally, some information on corrosion products have been achieved useful to select materials and methods for the conservation of these important witnesses of technology and economy.

However, in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula, which has one of the most outstanding protohistoric precious metalworking traditions in Western Europe, little attention has been paid to this method of accumulating raw material. This article provides the first systematic approach to the chemical composition of the precious metal ingots from this geographical area, based on the elemental analyses of 40 examples datable to the Late Iron Age and the early Roman presence. Two types of ingot composition have been identified: gold-silver-copper alloy and silver. In general, the former do not coincide with those documented in the jewellery from the hillforts (c. fourth-first centuries BC). This means that they could belong to the latest period of this metalworking tradition (c. first century BC-first century AD), when there was frequent use of cores of less valuable metals. In addition to their metallurgical function, silver ingots appear to have played an important role in the proto-monetary economy that characterised the early Roman presence. We propose that the different geographical distribution of these types of ingot was related to the diverse interactional dynamics generated between the local communities and the Romans during the long process of their conquest of this territory (138-19 BC).","[Armada, Xose-Lois] CSIC, Inst Heritage Sci Incipit, Avda Vigo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15705, Spain; [Garcia-Vuelta, Oscar] CSIC, Inst Hist IH, Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Patrimonio (INCIPIT); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC),"Armada, XL (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Heritage Sci Incipit, Avda Vigo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15705, Spain.",xose-lois.armada@incipit.csic.es; oscar.gvuelta@cchs.csic.es,"Armada, Xose-Lois/J-3827-2013","Garcia-Vuelta, Oscar/0000-0002-4032-569X; Armada, Xose-Lois/0000-0002-0110-0201","Xunta de Galicia [IN607D 2016/004, 10 PXIB 606 016 PR]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [HAR2015-64632-P]",Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"This study has been carried out within the framework of the 'Technological innovation, metal circulation and prestige metallic artefacts in Atlantic Europe (13th-1st cent.

Such metal-enhanced fluorescence was efficiently quenched with Congo red dye (CR), producing CRAgOSA, due to the strong silver-sulfur interaction, replacing the capping of quinone (oxidized salicylaldehyde). The introduction of cobalt ions restored the fluorescence by engaging CR (CoCRAgOSA). Cobalt-induced fluorescence enhancement was 8.3 times higher than that of AgOSA due to the freeing of CR and the release of self-quenching of excess quinone molecules in CoCRAgOSA. The mammoth and selective fluorescence enhancement with ionic cobalt assisted in designing a turn-on ionic cobalt sensor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.4 x 10-11 M and a linear detection range (5 x 10-5 to 10-9 M). Moreover, toxic CR dye was eliminated by quinone-capped silver nanoparticles and Co2+ due to chemisorption. Not only the fluorimetric sensing of ionic cobalt but also the colorimetric sensing of Hg2+ was designed due to the simultaneous aggregation of AgNPs and complexation with CR induced by Hg2+ (LOD 1.36 x 10-5 M and linear detection range from 1.00 x 10-4 to 5 x 10-7 M). We applied our sensing method to estimate ionic cobalt and mercury in natural samples. The experiment was a unique case of circular economy, where a toxic dye was used for making a nanosensor.

Based on a multiple wavelet coherence analysis, combined with Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (DCC-GARCH). The uni-directional co-movement is sequential, running from gold to the remaining metals. Silver leads platinum and palladium in returns, and platinum leading palladium. Interestingly, silver and platinum combined contribute to the variability of gold, while gold, silver, and palladium contribute to the variability of platinum, suggesting that some lead-lag relationships are complex and strengthened by multivariate relationships among the metals. The lead-lag dependence is high at medium and long investment horizons and responds to economic, political, and pandemic shocks to the global economy. We find that a wavelet-based dynamic hedging strategy performs better than a conventional hedging strategy. Portfolio weights from the bivariate, three-dimensional, and four-dimensional wavelet analyses vary across investment horizons. Finally, utility gains are higher at long horizons for all multi-dimensional risk strategies, whereas the utility gains are lower with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Nekhili, Ramzi] Appl Sci Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, East Al Ekir, Bahrain; [Sultan, Jahangir] Bentley Univ, Dept Finance, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Mensi, Walid] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman; [Mensi, Walid] South Ural State Univ, 76 Lenin Prospekt, Chelyabinsk, Russia",Bentley University; Sultan Qaboos University; South Ural State University,"Mensi, W (通讯作者)，Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Finance, Muscat, Oman.",ramzi.nekhili@asu.edu.bh; jsultan@bentley.edu; walidmensi1@gmail.com,"mensi, walid/R-6139-2016; Nekhili, Ramzi/P-1385-2015; Nekhili, Ramzi/P-7278-2016","Nekhili, Ramzi/0000-0001-8629-2654",,,,,55,11,11,1,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

In this regard, a mixed-integer linear programming model, which aims at maximizing the profit from the flow in the supply chain network, is developed. The model is tested with actual data obtained from a printed circuit board firm in Turkey that aims an optimal distribution in its supply chain. The results reveal that the product/material flows, which have an impact on the revenues, are among the most important factors affecting the profitability. According to results, the circular economy objectives increase the revenue obtained in the hybrid open-loop and closed-loop supply chain.

Various rinsing baths are used: degreasing baths, alkaline copper-plating baths, acid copper-plating baths, nickel-plating baths and silver-plating baths. These rinsing baths are loaded with heavy metals (copper, silver and nickel). In order to treat these effluents to comply with the discharge limit values, the Ministry of Tourism, Crafts of Air Transport and Social Economy and Ibn Tofail University have agreed to launch a research collaboration to study the feasibility of membrane-based processes - electrodialysis (ED), nanofiltration and reverse osmosis - in the treatment of these effluents. This first study aims to investigate the removal of heavy metals from rinsing baths by ED. Two couples of ion-exchange membranes have been tested ACS/CMX and AXE/CMX. Using the selected couple of ion-exchange membranes (CMX/AXE), the treatment by ED of mixing of all rinsing baths, brassware wastewater loaded with copper, silver, nickel is performed.

That is, capital continues to devise innovative strategies to restructure the labour process and avoid employer legal liabilities. This study reveals an important but somewhat overlooked financial fix aspect of the platform economy. Through a case study of a Chinese food delivery platform, the author shows that global speculative capital and its cash-burning games have generated a form of market-value fetishism in this sector. In response, platform companies have devised innovative labour acquisition strategies to expand their market share that have profoundly shaped the work and employment dynamics within the sector. In particular, the platform companies engaged in a subsidy rivalry with their competitors in order to attract crowdsourcing/gig workers for their regular services and at the same time established a highly structured subcontracting system to secure a more reliable and committed workforce to target the relatively high-end consumer market. The author argues that the interaction between global financialization and local capital's strategic choices accounts for the peculiar structure and employment dynamics in the Chinese platform economy.","[Zhang, Hao] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhang-hao@ruc.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Hao/0000-0003-0232-5565",National Social Science Foundation of China [19CSH037],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research was supported by a grant from the National Social Science Foundation of China (19CSH037).,,34,1,1,11,38,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0305-7410,1468-2648,,CHINA QUART,China Q.,SEP,2024,259,,,,,,785,803,,10.1017/S0305741023001832,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0305741023001832,,JAN 2024,19,Area Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies,M7M1R,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001147750100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, microalgae have great potential due to their energy content, high growth rate, short harvest cycle, and remarkable carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation capacity. However, using this microorganism on a large scale is expensive, especially in the cultivation stage. Thus, nanoparticles have been evaluated as a promising alternative to assist in the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae, offering solutions for different stages of the processes. Furthermore, nanomaterials contribute to the economic viability and processing efficiency of microalgae-based products that can be essential in mitigating or preventing adverse environmental impacts. In this context, this review addresses the contribution of microalgae biotechnology using nanostructures for biorefinery systems. Moreover, this article demonstrates nanoparticles and nanofibers' benefits for biorefineries and their potential application to the blue economy concept.","[Lopes, Larissa Chivanski; Felix da Costa, Marcia Raquel; Vieira Costa, Jorge Alberto] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Biochem Engn, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [de Morais, Michele Greque; Moreira, Juliana Botelho] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Microbiol & Biochem, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande,"Moreira, JB (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Microbiol & Biochem, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",julianapvi@yahoo.com.br,"Morais, Michele/J-7539-2015; Costa, Jorge/L-3999-2013; Moreira, Juliana Botelho/D-5322-2017","Moreira, Juliana Botelho/0000-0003-3340-6333; Chivanski Lopes, Larissa/0000-0003-0266-1382",Capes-PrInt Program [88887.310848/2018-00]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001],Capes-PrInt Program; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research was developed within the scope of the Capes-PrInt Program (Process # 88887.310848/2018-00).

From a sociological point of view, the latter analyses deserve particular interest, as they consider the crisis in the context of the larger structural changes of mature capitalist societies that have developed since the last decades of the 20th century. The paper first provides an overview of the financialization literature, focussing of the interplay between the changes on the macro-, meso-and micro levels of society that led to the present dominance of the financial services sector over the economy. Moreover, the historical analyses of Arrighi and Silver are considered. The second part of the paper offers a theoretical reconceptualization of the empirical findings in the framework of a multilevel model of capitalist dynamics. The model shows how a prosperous capitalist economy like the Western one in the second half of the 20th century can be transformed into a financialized economy due to its own internal dynamics. From a sociological perspective, financialization can thus be understood as a hegemonial regime of financial investors over entrepreneurs.","[Deutschmann, Christoph] Univ Tubingen, Cologne, Germany; [Deutschmann, Christoph] Max Planck Inst Gesell Forsch, Cologne, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society,"Deutschmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Cologne, Germany.",christoph.deutschmann@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,106,35,36,0,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-9756,1474-0583,,ARCH EUR SOCIOL,Arch.

With the Napoleonic invasion of Spain in 1808, the fiscal and political structure of the empire imploded and most colonies became independent. Regional competition for revenues exacerbated budget shortfalls driven by military expenditure. Local elites established in former colonial Treasury districts started highly diverse monetary experiments to procure funds. Those in control of mint houses started minting their own coins or debased existing silver currency. Elsewhere, inconvertible paper currency was also created to meet budget deficits. As a result, the most valuable feature of the Spanish American silver peso, its quality standard, was broken and the standard that had organized the early modern international economy for more than 300 years ceased to exist altogether. In Spanish America, as diverse monies co-existed within a formerly highly integrated economic space, a widespread Gresham's law effect exacerbated the conflict among local and regional elites. This fostered the political fragmentation of colonial Spanish America into an increasing number of political and monetary sovereign entities during the nineteenth century.","Coll New Jersey, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA",College of New Jersey,"Irigoin, MA (通讯作者)，Coll New Jersey, Ewing, NJ 08628 USA.",,,"Irigoin, Alejandra/0000-0001-5395-1537",,,,,48,14,18,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In 1994, the World Bank (WB) saw population ageing as a crisis that needed 'averting'. The United Nations (UN) approach evolved from the individualized, compassionate ageism of 1981 to a developmental, 'society for all ages', perspective in 2002. Yet the UN made comparatively little headway. In 2021 the UN launched its Decade of Healthy Ageing to support the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda's 'leave no one behind' goal. The UN rightly sees ageing as a lifelong, societal and developmental process and strongly supported the evidence that unequal resource distribution is the main contributor to health inequalities across the lifespan. Despite this evidence, the focus is now on a biomedical framing of impaired health and on a multi-stakeholder approach that emphasizes the Silver Economy's economic potential. The first two years of the decade saw significant efforts to generate private-sector support. While the Decade of Healthy Ageing is still young, there is much good, harm and missed opportunity that can happen in a decade, justifying early consideration of what the Silver Economy's biomedical approach will do for older people in low and middle income countries (LMICs).","[Vera-Sanso, Penny] Birkbeck Univ London, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Vera-Sanso, P (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, London, England.",p.vera-sanso@bbk.ac.uk,"Vera-Sanso, Penny/E-2001-2015","Vera-Sanso, Penny/0000-0002-3163-399X",I thank Alison Marshall and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful commentary on the original draft.

More effective materials, especially those promoting ease of use and economy, are needed to treat this increasing number of patients. A case series conducted at a European outpatient tertiary wound centre used a novel surfactant-based biomaterial dressing containing 1% silver sulphadiazine on 226 chronic wound patients with various aetiologies. Eighty-eight patients had been undergoing standard of care treatment at the facility, while the remainder (n = 138) began treatment with the surfactant-based biomaterial dressing on enrollment. A total of 73% of the first group healed or showed improvement, with 60% healing by a median of 17 weeks after beginning treatment, and 86% of the group of new enrollees healed or showed improvement, with 73% healing within a median of 12 weeks of beginning treatment with the new product. Patient and clinician reports showed improved compliance, reduced pain and a favourable side-effect profile. Limited economic analysis showed markedly reduced treatment costs compared with standard of care.

In the first-stage laboratory scale tests, 99% Al was extracted using 5% HCl at room temperature (19 degrees C) for 3 h The Al was precipitated as oxide from the solution. The silicon residue was then leached with 0.5 M HNO3 at 85 degrees C for 2 h, extracting 99% Ag and producing Si with 99.83% purity. The silver was precipitated to produce metallic Ag with >99.9% purity. Then, 95.63% of Pb in the nitric acid effluent was removed using ion exchange resins. Further, methods to mitigate the effluent solutions were recommended and the entire process was presented in a flowsheet.","[Mwase, James Malumbo; Yilmaz, Duygu] Inst Energy Technol IFE, Environm Ind Proc, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway; [Wahl, Stefanie; Meyer, Sylke] Fraunhofer Ctr Silicon Photovolta CSP, Otto Eissfeldt Str 12, D-06120 Halle, Germany",Institute for Energy Technology (IFE),"Mwase, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Energy Technol IFE, Environm Ind Proc, N-2007 Kjeller, Norway.",thejmwase@gmail.com; stefanie.wahl@csp.fraunhofer.de; sylke.meyer@csp.fraunhofer.de; duygu.yilmaz@ife.no,"YILMAZ, Duygu/AAJ-8294-2020",", James Mwase/0009-0001-7401-1541; Yilmaz, Duygu/0000-0002-4142-4788",European Union's Horizon Europe [101122332]; European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program,European Union's Horizon Europe; European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program,This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101122332.,,23,0,0,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,NOV,2024,12,11,,,,,,,2454,10.3390/pr12112454,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr12112454,,,9,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,N8Z4X,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001367146900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nanocoating and electrospinning are two versatile, simple, and low-cost technologies that can be combined into new advanced manufacturing approaches to achieve controlled production of innovative micro- and nano-structured non-woven membranes with antifouling and antibacterial properties. The present study investigates a rational approach to design and manufacture electrospun membranes of polysulfone (PSU) with mechanical properties optimized via combinatorial testing from factorial design of experiments (DOE) and endowed with antimicrobial silver (Ag) nanocoating. Despite the very low amount of Ag deposited as a conformal percolating nanocoating web on the polymer fibers, the antimicrobial resistance assessed against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli proved to be extremely effective, almost completely inhibiting the microbial proliferation with respect to the reference uncoated PSU membrane. The results are relevant, for example, to improve antifouling behavior in ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis in water treatment.","[Fiaschini, Noemi] NANOFABER Srl, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Giuliani, Chiara; Rinaldi, Antonio] ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS MATPRO, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Vitali, Roberta] ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT TECS TEB, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Tammaro, Loredana] ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS NANO, Piazzale E Fermi 1, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Valerini, Daniele] ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS MATAS, SS 7 Appia,Km 706, I-72100 Brindisi, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Rinaldi, A (通讯作者)，ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS MATPRO, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy.;Vitali, R (通讯作者)，ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT TECS TEB, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Rome, Italy.;Tammaro, L (通讯作者)，ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS NANO, Piazzale E Fermi 1, I-80055 Naples, Italy.;Valerini, D (通讯作者)，ENEA Italian Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Susta, SSPT PROMAS MATAS, SS 7 Appia,Km 706, I-72100 Brindisi, Italy.",roberta.vitali@enea.it; loredana.tammaro@enea.it; daniele.valerini@enea.it; antonio.rinaldi@enea.it,"Vitali, Roberta/JCD-8815-2023; Rinaldi, Antonio/AGB-1964-2022; Valerini, Daniele/AAB-2493-2019","Rinaldi, Antonio/0000-0002-3087-2649; Valerini, Daniele/0000-0003-0472-210X; Tammaro, Loredana/0000-0002-7948-8103; Fiaschini, Noemi/0000-0003-1094-7743",NEWSKIN Project [862100],NEWSKIN Project,"N.F. acknowledges that this research was partially funded by the NEWSKIN Project, grant number 862100.",,31,7,7,7,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,NOV,2022,12,22,,,,,,,3962,10.3390/nano12223962,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano12223962,,,16,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,6K6RA,36432247,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000887625400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In modern times, selective etching is widely used to create nanoporous metals, some of which are integral to industries like Raney Ni catalysis. Until now, however, a significant drawback of selective etching is that the removed sacrificial metals, often accounting for over 50 % of the parent material, are waste products. In this article, we demonstrate a versatile electrochemical method for making nanoporous metals that nearly eliminates the loss of sacrificial materials. This method, referred to as chlorine-neutral etching, uses Cl to introduce nanoporosity in metals through the Kirkendall effect, with nearly full recovery of Cl. Etching without losing sacrificial materials will enable a circular economy. Here, we demonstrate this new concept by fabricating a tri-layer nanoporous Ag | Ag | Ag.","[Ng, Alexander K.; Koh, Hyeongjun; Detsi, Eric] Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Detsi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",detsi@seas.upenn.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) , Division of Materials Research (DMR) [2134715, 1720530]; NSF MRI [1725969]; NSF NNCI [2025608]","National Science Foundation (NSF) , Division of Materials Research (DMR)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF MRI(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF NNCI(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) , Division of Materials Research (DMR) [Future Manufacturing Research Grant #2134715 and MRSEC Grant #1720530] .

Understanding the interaction of ethanol with Ag(111) and the natural defects found on extended Ag(111) is critical to the overall understanding of more complex catalytic processes including ethanol activation over Ag-based catalysts. The research herein aims to characterize the interaction of ethanol molecules on undercoordinated defect sites of Ag(111) to mimic active sites found on Ag nanoparticle catalysts. The interaction between ethanol and Ag(111) was studied using temperature programed desorption (TPD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT). Molecular ethanol adsorption and desorption from Ag(111) and the distinction between undercoordinated Ag(111) adsorption sites were determined using TPD in correlation with DFT. Complete analysis of TPD data for ethanol adsorbed to terrace sites was used to calculate a kinetic prefactor (3.4x10(15)) and desorption energy (0.54eV). A better understanding of defect-dependent behavior for ethanol on silver can lead to a greater insight into high surface area nanoparticle catalysts used in industries, catalytic converters, and photo-, electro-, and heterogeneous catalysis. The results suggest that ethanol preferentially adsorbs to undercoordinated sites on Ag(111), resulting in higher binding energies for these molecules (Redhead first order approximation for desorption energies is terrace, 0.54eV; step edge, 0.57eV; and kink sites, 0.61eV). Furthermore, alteration of the silver surface can lead to a redistribution of these sites.","[Schlosser, Daniel A.; Kaleem, Hasan; Maxwell, Eric M.; Baker, Jordon S.; Gillum, Maxwell Z.; DePonte, Maria C.; Baber, Ashleigh E.] James Madison Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, 901 Carrier Dr, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Yehorova, Dariia; Letchworth-Weaver, Kendra] James Madison Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 901 Carrier Dr, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",James Madison University; James Madison University,"Baber, AE (通讯作者)，James Madison Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, 901 Carrier Dr, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",baberae@jmu.edu,,"Letchworth-Weaver, Kendra/0000-0002-3060-1670; Baber, Ashleigh/0000-0003-3757-8562","Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar Award [4-VA]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences [DE-AC02-06CH11357]","Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar Award; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","A.E.B. acknowledges support from the Research Corporation for Science Advancement Cottrell Scholar Award, 4-VA, a collaborative partnership for advancing the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Catherine Dukes of University of Virginia's Department of Material Science and Engineering for her expertise and help with XPS experiments.

AgNPs formation was established by surface plasmon resonance at 480 nm. The crystallinity of the synthesised AgNPs was checked by HR-TEM and XRD analysis. SEM and TEM characterisation further exhibited the spherical, monodispersed, well scattered nature of the AgNPs with an average particle size of 11.8 nm +/- 2.8. The presence of (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes in Bragg's reflections confirmed the face-cantered-cubic crystalline silver. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver. FT-IR spectra revealed functional groups were responsible for the reduction of silver ions. The zeta potential value of -17.3 mV and -25.6 mV was recorded in MH and DMEM/F-12 media, respectively. The LC-QTOF/MS and HRMS spectra disclosed the presence of bioactive compounds like flavonoid, gallic acid, and stigmasterol, which are probably involved in the reduction and functionalization of AgNPs. The antibacterial efficacy of bio-molecule functionalized AgNPs and the naked AgNPs was tested on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from silkworms and characterized by using 16S rDNA andgyrBgenes. The cytotoxicity of AgNPs was tested on WRL-68, HEK-293, ACHN, and HUH-7 cell lines using MTT assay. This study provides an insight into the application of bio-molecule functionalized AgNPs for combating various silkworm pathogens which severely affect the agro-rural economy of developing countries.","[Some, Sudip; Dam, Paulami; Mondal, Rittick; Mandal, Amit Kumar] Raiganj Univ, Dept Sericulture, Chem Biol Lab, Raiganj 733134, India; [Sarkar, Biraj; Mandal, Sukhendu] Univ Calcutta, Lab Mol Bacteriol, Dept Microbiol, Kolkata 700019, India; [Biswas, Kinkar] Raiganj Univ, Dept Chem, Lab Organ Synth, Raiganj 733134, India; [Jana, Tushar Kanti] Vidyasagar Univ, Dept Phys, Midnapore 721102, India; [Bhattacharjya, Debjoy; Saha, Soumen] Raiganj Univ, Dept Sericulture, Cytogenet & Plant Biotechnol Res Unit, Raiganj 733134, India; [Kumar, Anoop] North Bengal Univ, Dept Biotechnol, ANMOL Lab, Darjeeling 734013, India; [Deb, Apurba Kanti] Raiganj Univ, Dept Phys, Raiganj 733134, India; [Sadat, Abdul] Raiganj Univ, Dept Sericulture, Insect Ecol & Conservat Biol Lab, Raiganj 733134, India; [Kati, Ahmet] Univ Hlth Sci, Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Biotechnol, TR-34668 Istanbul, Turkey; [Ocsoy, Ismail] Erciyes Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Analyt Chem, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Franco, Octavio L.] Catholic Univ Dom Bosco, Postgrad Program Biotechnol, S INOVA Biotech, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Mandal, Amitava] Raiganj Univ, Dept Chem, Mol Complex Lab, Raiganj 733134, India; [Mandal, Amit Kumar] Raiganj Univ, Ctr Nanotechnol Sci, Raiganj 733134, India; [Kati, Ahmet; Ince, Ikbal Agah] Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, TR-34752 Istanbul, Turkey",University of Calcutta; Vidyasagar University; University of North Bengal; Erciyes University; Universidade Catolica Dom Bosco (UCDB); Acibadem University,"Mandal, AK (通讯作者)，Raiganj Univ, Dept Sericulture, Chem Biol Lab, Raiganj 733134, India.;Mandal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Lab Mol Bacteriol, Dept Microbiol, Kolkata 700019, India.;Mandal, A (通讯作者)，Raiganj Univ, Dept Chem, Mol Complex Lab, Raiganj 733134, India.;Mandal, AK (通讯作者)，Raiganj Univ, Ctr Nanotechnol Sci, Raiganj 733134, India.",sukhendu1@hotmail.com; amitmandal08@gmail.com,"Kumar, Anoop/ABB-7336-2020; Franco, Octavio/T-3020-2017; Mandal, Amit/AAP-3437-2020; Mandal, Sukhendu/AAX-6423-2021; KATI, AHMET/AAB-5490-2022; Mondal, Rittick/AAJ-7090-2021; ocsoy, ismail/M-8225-2015; saha, soumen/AFM-1995-2022; Jana, Dr. Tushar Kanti/AAA-3861-2022; ince, ikbal agah/I-2976-2013","Franco, Octavio/0000-0001-9546-0525; Kumar, Anoop/0000-0001-9061-9533; Mandal, Amit/0000-0001-9249-5052; Mandal, Sukhendu/0000-0002-7752-0982; Jana, Dr. Tushar Kanti/0000-0002-3267-7636; Ocsoy, Ismail/0000-0002-5991-3934; ince, ikbal agah/0000-0003-2299-9946; Some, Dr. Sudip/0000-0002-8325-3606; Sadat, Abdul/0000-0002-9975-0690; Mondal, Rittick/0000-0002-3312-0864; Saha, Soumen/0000-0003-0072-3359; DAM, PAULAMI/0000-0003-3454-8245",,,,,76,48,49,1,13,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,2046-2069,,RSC ADV,RSC Adv.,JUN 14,2020,10,38,,,,,22742,22757,,10.1039/d0ra03451g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03451g,,,16,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,ME1DB,35514551,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000544401200054,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the identification of occurrence forms of copper, cobalt, and lead in the silver tailings, the process parameters of the Na2CO3 roasting and acid leaching were optimized. The silver tailings were mixed with sodium carbonate at a mass ratio of 1:1.3 and roasted at 750 degrees C for 30 min, and the roasted clinker was leached using water at 80 degrees C for 15 min. The water leaching residue was then leached using H2SO4 acid at a concentration of 3 mol/L, a liquid-solid ratio of 10 mL/g, and at room temperature for 3 min. We finally obtained leaching efficiencies of 97.02 % and 86.45 % for copper and cobalt, respectively; 79.17 % of lead went into the acid leaching residue. The copper and cobalt were significantly enriched in the polymetallic enriched ore powder at 10.76 and 7.12 times the content in the tailings, respectively, reaching industrial grade that could be used as a new type of ore raw material for the extraction of copper and cobalt. Lead was enriched in the acid leaching residue at a content of 7.61 times that of the tailings and was mixed with the tailings to be further roasted and leached to enrich the lead. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the full resource utilization of metallic tailings.","[Chang, Jie; Ma, Yuzhao] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Pan, Aifang] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Inst Interdisciplinary & Innovate Res, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Pan, Aifang; Sun, Yue] Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Xian 710054, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology; Chang'an University,"Ma, YZ (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.;Pan, AF (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Inst Interdisciplinary & Innovate Res, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",panaifang@xauat.edu.cn; mayuzhao@xauat.edu.cn,"Zhang, yueling/HZH-7176-2023","Pan, Aifang/0000-0003-0076-9058","Education Department of Shaanxi Province, China [21JY027]","Education Department of Shaanxi Province, China","This work was supported by the Education Department of Shaanxi Province, China [Grant No. 21JY027] .",,44,1,2,16,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1383-5866,1873-3794,,SEP PURIF TECHNOL,Sep.

Cobalters regard aspects of this downward deflection of the locus of economic responsibility as fairer, and more transparent, than the previous funding regime. We show how a local moral economy and understanding of citizenship based on an ethic of caring has contributed, in a counterintuitive way, to an interim outcome of more public services. At the same time, the current pursuit of development funds via proposal is undermining the practices of civic engagement which have allowed the town to remain distinct for the past century.","[Stern, Pamela; Hall, Peter V.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Stern, P (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",pamela_stern@sfu.ca,/R-6776-2019,"Hall, Peter/0000-0002-8214-0351",,,,,34,7,9,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0308-275X,,,CRIT ANTHROPOL,Crit.

In this study a natural zeolite was impreg-nated with silver to derive Ag+, Ag2O and Ag0 forms. The natural and Ag-zeolites were effectively used for the removal of mercury from Hg(NO3)2 and HgCl2 aqueous solutions. Kinetic experi-ments, aqueous phase speciation modeling and post-sorption characterizations were used to in-terpret the sorption behavior of the zeolites. Natural zeolite is effective in removing mercury from Hg(NO3)2 solutions but sorption is negligible from HgCl2 solutions. Silver modification trans-formed the natural zeolite into an effective nanocomposite sorbent for mercury removal from HgCl2 solutions, the effectiveness being affected by the Ag form. However, Ag modification had no effect on the removal from Hg(NO3)2 solutions. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between ion exchange, surface Ag-Hg reactions and the aqueous phase Hg speciation which was further supported by complementary experiments with iodide under the same conditions. For comparison, Hg removal by commercial adsorbents, namely an activated carbon, a cation ex-change resin and synthetic zeolite Y is presented. The results demonstrate that natural zeolite and Ag0 form are effective adsorbents performing better than commercial ion exchangers and are comparable to activated carbon. The use of abundant, cheap, environmental-friendly and easy to modify natural zeolite is an attractive alternative to commercial and other unsustainable and dif-ficult to synthesize adsorbent materials.","[Inglezakis, Vassilis J.] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Glasgow, Scotland; [Kudarova, Aliya] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn & Digital Sci, Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan; [Kinayat, Nurassyl] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn & Digital Sci, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan; [Guney, Almira; Kinayat, Nurassyl] Nazarbayev Univ, Environm & Resource Efficiency Cluster EREC, Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan; [Tauanov, Zhandos] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Chem & Chem Technol, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Tauanov, Zhandos] LLP Sci Prod Tech Ctr Zhalyn, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",University of Strathclyde; Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University; Al-Farabi Kazakh National University,"Inglezakis, VJ (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Chem & Proc Engn, Glasgow, Scotland.",vasileios.inglezakis@strath.ac.uk,"Inglezakis, Vassilis/F-8554-2013; Tauanov, Zhandos/N-2999-2014","Inglezakis, Vassilis/0000-0002-0195-0417",Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan [AP14869646],Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan(Government of the Republic of KazakhstanMinistry of Science & Higher Education of the Republic of KazakhstanScience Committee of the Ministry of Science & Higher Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan),Funding This research has been (partially) funded by the Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Grant No. AP14869646) .,,73,16,16,10,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-5541,,SUSTAIN CHEM PHARM,SUSTAIN.

Impregnation of silver nanoparticles on P25 TiO2 was done using the same procedure. Commercial TiO2 was also modified under simple heat treatment to make combusted TiO2. To probe the challenge of photodegradation of a known carcinogen, malachite green (MG), we have investigated the UV-induced photodegradation of MG in aqueous medium using all these modified TiO2 catalysts in order to evaluate the effect of silver impregnation. We report that the presence of silver in TiO2 enhances the photon induced mineralization of MG but reduces the decolorization efficiency. Based on both decolorization and mineralization, and also on the cost and availability, 1% silver impregnated commercial TiO2 was found the optimal. The degradation of MG using this catalyst has been investigated in a more detail, and the effect of pH, stirring, initial MG concentration, catalyst dose, nature of light, and the presence of interfering ions/organics are examined. The dye (similar to 25 mg/l) is bleached almost completely upon 1 h of light irradiation under experimental conditions. The degradation follows zero-order kinetics over the entire MG concentration range (25-125 mg/l), and we presume that the degradation occurs via step-wise N-demethylation. Most importantly, we observe high turn over frequency (TOF) for our catalyst. This makes the catalytic process cost-effective and the catalyst recycle able. Further, a cost-analysis is made to evaluate the proper selection of the catalyst in terms of efficiency and economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They are a crucial lever for resource efficiency and a sustainable circular economy. While material stock research has proliferated over the last years, most studies investigated specific materials or end-uses, usually not embedded into an economy-wide perspective. Herein, we present a novel version of the economy-wide, dynamic, inflow-driven model of material inputs, stocks, and outputs (MISO2), and present a global, country-level application. Currently, MISO2 covers 14 supply chain processes from raw material extraction to processing, trade, recycling, and waste management, as well as 13 end-uses of stocks. The derived database covers 23 raw materials and 20 stock-building materials, across 177 countries from 1900 to 2016. We find that total material stocks amount to 1093 Gt in 2016, of which the majority are residential (290 Gt) and non-residential buildings (234 Gt), as well as civil engineering (243 Gt), and roads (313 Gt). The other nine end-uses covering stationary and mobile machinery, as well as short-lived products, amount to 13 Gt. Material stocks per capita are highly unequally distributed around the world, with one order of magnitude difference between low- and high-income countries. Results agree well with similar global country-level studies. Low data quality for some domains, especially for lower-income countries and for sand and gravel aggregates, warrant further attention. In conclusion, the MISO2 model and the derived database provide stock-flow consistent perspectives of the socio-economic metabolism around the world, enabling multiple novel and policy relevant research opportunities.

Taking this view, this study used a green approach to synthesize two forms of silver nanoparticles: coated silver nanoparticles with olive leaf extract (Ag-olive) and uncoated pure silver nanoparticles (Ag-pure), which were produced by the calcination of Ag-olive at 550 degrees C. The extract and the fabricated nanoparticles were characterized by a variety of physicochemical techniques, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Adult ticks (Hyalomma dromedarii) (Acari: Ixodidae) were used in this study to evaluate the antiparasitic activity of synthesized nanoparticles and extract. Furthermore, the antifungal activity was evaluated against Aspergillus aculeatus strain N (MW958085), Fuserium oxysporum (MT550034), and Alternaria tenuissiuma (MT550036). In both antiparasitic and antifungal tests, the as-synthesized Ag-olive showed higher inhibition activity than Ag-pure and olive leaf extract. The findings of this research suggest that Ag-olive may be a powerful and eco-friendly antiparasitic and antifungal agent.

Five coffee varieties were planted in silver oak shade in a randomized block design with four replications. The aim of the present investigation is to assess the economic and ecological feasibility of forest-based coffee plantations in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. Findings reflect the maximum under-storied plant height in Chandragiri Dwarf (1.85 m) which was at par with CxR (1.82 m) and San Ramon (1.71 m). The maximum above and below-ground carbon stock (48.40 and 12.09 Mg ha(-1), respectively), as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation (177.63 and 44.41 Mg ha(-1), respectively) from the under-storied coffee plantation, was recorded in CxR. In the upper-storied plantation, the above and below-ground biomass of silver oak recorded the maximum carbon stock (201.24 and 50.31 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and CO2 mitigation (738.54 and 184.63 Mg ha(-1)) in S-8 intercropped lines. The highest value of carbon credit was recorded under the coffee variety S-8 and silver oak agroecosystem. The S-8, CxR, and Chandragiri Dwarf varieties performed quite well in terms of the expected value of carbon credit.","[Singh, Krishan Pal; Shukla, Rajshree; Sahu, Khemraj] IGKV, Coll Hort & Res Stn, Bastar 494001, India; [Singh, Beena] IGKV, SG Coll Agr & Res Stn, Bastar 494001, India; [Patil, Sanjay Kumar] Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur 494012, India; [Rahangdale, Chhatra Pal] IGKV, KVK, Surguja 497111, India; [Banerjee, Arnab] St Gahira Guru Vishwavidyalaya, Dept Environm Sci, Ambikapur 497001, India; [Jhariya, Manoj Kumar] St Gahira Guru Vishwavidyalaya, Dept Farm Forestry, Ambikapur 497001, India","Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (IGKV); Sant Gahira Guru Vishwavidyalaya, Sarguja; Sant Gahira Guru Vishwavidyalaya, Sarguja","Jhariya, MK (通讯作者)，St Gahira Guru Vishwavidyalaya, Dept Farm Forestry, Ambikapur 497001, India.",manu9589@gmail.com,"JHARIYA, DR.

A novel hybrid synthesis method was developed, which included the crystallization stage of zeolites, together with silver or iron modification. The method applied resulted in obtaining the pure and high-crystalline zeolites of faujasite and Linde Type A groups. The starting materials - fly ashes, untreated zeolites X and A and their silver -and iron-modified analogues - were subjected to mercury adsorption tests using a novel prototype installation. Untreated zeolites and their iron-activated analogues, had negligible mercury uptake. In the case of silver -modified zeolites, the adsorption of mercury was significantly improved. The starting materials - fly ashes - also presented a positive affinity with mercury removal. The highest mercury uptake was observed for zeolites X, derived from the fly ash obtained after hard coal combustion and modified with variable amounts of silver ni-trate. The proposed novel hybrid synthesis method has the potential for implementation for both fly ash utili-zation, as well as the time and energy saving production of aluminosilicate, i.e., porous materials with high elemental mercury removal efficiency. This fits the idea of the circular economy and creates opportunities for the disposal of hazardous elemental mercury - an unwanted by-product of the energy industry based on coal combustion.","[Kunecki, Piotr; Wdowin, Magdalena; Hanc, Emil] Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7a, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Mineral & Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Kunecki, P (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7a, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland.",pkunecki@min-pan.krakow.pl,"Kunecki, Piotr/A-4830-2019; Wdowin, Magdalena/A-4838-2019; Hanc, Emil/F-7558-2019","Kunecki, Piotr/0000-0002-9890-4635; Hanc, Emil/0000-0002-1318-7674","National Center for Research and Development, project LIDER [LIDER/384/L-6/14/NCBR/2015]","National Center for Research and Development, project LIDER","Fig. 7.

Silver fir emerges as the dominant species in construction within the Vesuvian region. While this species once thrived more abundantly along the Apennines, it now exists only in small, isolated groups, raising the possibility that the Romans contributed to its scarcity. Nevertheless, the origins of the substantial quantity of silver fir wood discovered in Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the surrounding areas remain unclear. This study examines 35 wood samples obtained during the excavation of the Moregine site, an ancient commercial port located a mere 600 m to the south of Pompeii's walls. Dendrochronological analysis successfully dated 19 out of the 35 samples. Despite silver fir not being the ideal species for dendroprovenancing analysis, certain observations can be made regarding its likely foreign origin. The correlation with chronologies of different species of Central European origin, the presence of species such as spruce/larch among the structural material and the existence of different groups among the material analysed are strong indications that demonstrate the foreign origin of at least some of the timber. Dendrochronological data further support that the wood trade played a strategically significant role in the economy of ancient Rome.","[Bernabei, Mauro] CNR, Inst BioEcon, San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR),"Bernabei, M (通讯作者)，CNR, Inst BioEcon, San Michele All Adige, TN, Italy.",mauro.bernabei@ibe.cnr.it,"Bernabei, Mauro/AAI-7754-2020","Bernabei, Mauro/0000-0002-5218-3844",,,"The Author would like to thank Esther Jansma, Willy Tegel and Tomasz Waz ny for their suggestions and for sending long and well replicated reference series.",,36,2,2,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1040-6182,1873-4553,,QUATERN INT,Quat.

The aim is to identify and quantify major and trace elements in Roman silver-copper coins in order to assess changes in composition and to confirm the devaluation of the currency. After a first cataloguing step, mu-EDXRF and SEM-EDX techniques were performed to identify the elements on the coins' surface. A micro-destructive sampling method was employed on a representative sample of the coins to quantify the elements present in the bulk. The powder obtained from drilling 12 coins (keeping the two categories of coins separate) was dissolved in an acidic medium; heated and sonicated to facilitate dissolution; and then analysed by ICP-AES and ICP-MS. The two currencies had different average alloy percentages; in particular, the % difference of Ag was about 8%. The other elements were found in concentrations <1 wt%. Of these, the element highest in concentration were Pb and Sn, which is in agreement with the literature. The multivariate analysis performed on the data acquired revealed two groups of coins, corresponding to the two currencies.","[Marussi, Giovanna; Crosera, Matteo; Adami, Gianpiero] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Chim & Farmaceut, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Prenesti, Enrico] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Chim, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Cristofori, Davide] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Ctr Microscopia Elettron Giovanni Stevanato, Campus Sci, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Cristofori, Davide] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dipartimento Sci Mol & Nanosistemi, I-30172 Venice, Italy; [Callegher, Bruno] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Studi Umanist, I-34124 Trieste, Italy",University of Trieste; University of Turin; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Trieste,"Marussi, G; Adami, G (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Sci Chim & Farmaceut, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",giovanna.marussi@phd.units.it; gadami@units.it,"; CRISTOFORI, Davide/U-6201-2018; ADAMI, GIANPIERO/A-8746-2011","CALLEGHER, BRUNO/0000-0001-6536-7573; CRISTOFORI, Davide/0000-0002-1041-2282; Marussi, Giovanna/0009-0008-9812-746X; ADAMI, GIANPIERO/0000-0002-1608-2050",,,,,22,7,7,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,OCT,2022,27,20,,,,,,,6903,10.3390/molecules27206903,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules27206903,,,13,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,5S5XG,36296493,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000875261900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The existing literature has thus far focused predominantly on moderate, institutional, elite-oriented forms of contention over welfare policy reform. The article presents evidence that disruptive, innovative or elite-challenging forms of contention play an important role in welfare reform and should therefore be the subject of more sustained research. Pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis provides support for the claim that this more disruptive type of contention has a more significant and consistent impact on the process of welfare reform than do the institutional and moderate forms of contention that are more frequently studied (especially under adverse economic conditions and heightened levels of global socio-economic pressure). This is because (a) participants in acts of institutional, elite-oriented forms of contention more readily accede to elite discourse when it is asserted that welfare retrenchment measures are 'necessary'; and (b) moderate, elite-oriented activities are more easily ignored by policy makers.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Bailey, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",d.j.bailey@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,86,29,31,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In this Article, a greener photocatalytic process is shown to recover up to seven precious metals from waste successfully, offering the potential for wide application. Precious metals such as gold and platinum are valued materials for a variety of important applications, but their scarcity poses a risk of supply disruption. Recycling precious metals from waste provides a promising solution; however, conventional metallurgical methods bear high environmental costs and energy consumption. Here, we report a photocatalytic process that enables one to selectively retrieve seven precious metals-silver (Ag), gold (Au), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir)-from waste circuit boards, ternary automotive catalysts and ores. The whole process does not involve strong acids or bases or toxic cyanide, but needs only light and photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). More than 99% of the targeted elements in the waste sources can be dissolved and the precious metals recovered after a simple reducing reaction that shows a high purity (>= 98%). By demonstrating success at the kilogram scale and showing that the catalysts can be reused more than 100 times, we suggest that this approach might be industry compatible. This research opens up a new path in the development of sustainable technologies for recycling the Earth's resources and contributing to a circular economy.","[Chen, Yao; Xu, Mengjiao; Wen, Jieya; Wan, Yu; Zhao, Qingfei; Li, Hexing; Bian, Zhenfeng] Shanghai Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Resource Chem, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yao; Xu, Mengjiao; Wen, Jieya; Wan, Yu; Zhao, Qingfei; Li, Hexing; Bian, Zhenfeng] Shanghai Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Rare Earth Funct Mat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xia; Wang, Zhong Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Nanoenergy & Nanosyst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yong; Wang, Zhong Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Li, Hexing] Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Shanghai Normal University; Shanghai Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy & Nanosystems, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Shanghai University of Electric Power","Li, HX; Bian, ZF (通讯作者)，Shanghai Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Resource Chem, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Li, HX; Bian, ZF (通讯作者)，Shanghai Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Rare Earth Funct Mat, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZL (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Inst Nanoenergy & Nanosyst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZL (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;Li, HX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zlwang@gatech.edu; hexing-li@shnu.edu.cn; bianzhenfeng@shnu.edu.cn,"Ding, Yong/F-3705-2017; Bian, Zhenfeng/T-5949-2017; Xu, Meng/HJY-7139-2023; Wang, Zhong Lin/E-2176-2011","Wang, Zhong Lin/0000-0002-5530-0380; Bian, Zhenfeng/0000-0001-7552-8027","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFA0211004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21876114, 21761142011]; Shanghai Government [19DZ1205102, 19160712900, 18JC1412900]; Chinese Education Ministry Key Laboratory and International Joint Laboratory on Resource Chemistry; Shanghai Eastern Scholar Program; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Green Energy Chemical Engineering [18DZ2254200]",National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Government; Chinese Education Ministry Key Laboratory and International Joint Laboratory on Resource Chemistry; Shanghai Eastern Scholar Program; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Green Energy Chemical Engineering,"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2020YFA0211004), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 21876114 and 21761142011), Shanghai Government (nos. 19DZ1205102, 19160712900 and 18JC1412900), the Chinese Education Ministry Key Laboratory and International Joint Laboratory on Resource Chemistry, the Shanghai Eastern Scholar Program and the Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Green Energy Chemical Engineering (no. 18DZ2254200).",,42,299,307,96,693,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

The European Partnership for Active and Healthy Ageing report shows that much of this housing stock is unsuitable for the growing number of older residents with declining functional abilities, especially those needing long-term care (LTC) services. The article describes why and to what extent the problem is occurring. Also, we answer the question of what the dynamics of production of such specialized housing units for older adults in need of an LTC should be. We considered the production (masonry) of assisted living units and housing with care for independent and sheltered housing to mitigate the risk of events leading to illness and disability and thus increase the life expectancy of residents if the right housing stock is in place. The model is recommended to determine the dynamics of investment and production of such housing units. Mathematical programming is developed based on geo-gerontological projections of demand.

Services promoting wellbeing can have several benefits both on individual and national levels, and social connectedness, as one aspect of wellbeing, has been found to positively impact healthy ageing and quality of life among older adults. The aim of this study was to conduct a first exam of the potentials of a remote cultural event to facilitate social connectedness and well-being in a community of older adults through culture and the arts. This study utilised a qualitative exploratory approach in the form of a co-designed case study set in a Finnish care home. An opera streaming event was planned and organised in co-operation with multiple stakeholders including the residents. The results highlight the role of social interaction as part of a remote cultural experience, prior, during, and post-experience. Partaking in the event resulted in enhanced social connectedness, more positive views on technology and remote experiences, and overall satisfaction for joining. The social aspect, rituals, and etiquette are also present also in watching opera remotely, and emphasising these aspects in designing such services could leverage the potential that digital cultural experiences hold.","[Caiola, Valentina; Pillan, Margherita; Spallazzo, Davide] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Design, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Kares, Elina Moreira] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Serv Business Dev & Design, Helsinki 00520, Finland; [Tuomi, Aarni] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Hospitality Business, Helsinki 00520, Finland",Polytechnic University of Milan; Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences; Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences,"Pillan, M (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Design, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",valentina.caiola@polimi.it; elina.moreirakares@haaga-helia.fi; margherita.pillan@polimi.it; davide.spallazzo@polimi.it; aarni.tuomi@haaga-helia.fi,"Tuomi, Aarni/AAK-7168-2021; Spallazzo, Davide/D-4501-2018","Tuomi, Aarni/0000-0002-0515-1313; Spallazzo, Davide/0000-0002-2621-7617",,,,,80,2,2,9,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2023,15,13,,,,,,,10594,10.3390/su151310594,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151310594,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,M2GV2,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001028426500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among metallic MNPs, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) continue to be widely investigated for their robust antimicrobial properties across healthcare, consumer goods and other sectors. While conventional physical and chemical synthesis methods are well-established, they often rely on energy-intensive equipment and hazardous chemicals. This review examines the progress of green biosynthesis as a sustainable alternative for generating AgNP. Using plants, microbes and other renewable biomass as reducing and capping agents allows for fabrication under ambient conditions without toxic additives. Various characterization tools are explored to understand the physicochemical properties of the biogenic AgNP. Their functional integration into materials and devices for applications spanning water treatment, biomedicine and electronic coatings is also discussed. Several studies highlighted here demonstrate the industrial scalability of biosynthesis techniques. By analyzing recent works, this review illustrates how biomass-mediated synthesis can advance nanomanufacturing capabilities and establish cost-effective, clean production methods to power the ongoing growth of AgNP applications.","[Kumar, Dinesh; Tanwar, Rajni; Kumar, Vishal] Desh Bhagat Univ, Sch Pharm, Mandi Gobindgarh, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Sunil] Om Sterling Global Univ, Atam Inst Pharm, Hisar 125001, Haryana, India; [Gholap, Amol D.] St John Inst Pharm & Res, Dept Pharmaceut, Palghat 401404, Maharashtra, India; [Gholap, Amol D.] Amrutvahini Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut, Sangamner 422608, Maharashtra, India; [Kumari, Raman] Maharishi Markandeshwar Univ, Maharishi Markandeshwar Coll Pharm, Ambala 133207, Haryana, India; [Khalid, Mohammad] Sunway Univ, Sunway Ctr Electrochem Energy & Sustainable Techno, Sch Engn & Technol, 5 Jalan Univ, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Khalid, Mohammad] Manipal Univ Jaipur, Fac Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Khalid, Mohammad] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Ctr Res & Dev, Mohali 140413, Punjab, India; [Faiyazuddin, Md.] Al Karim Univ, Sch Pharm, Katihar 854106, Bihar, India; [Faiyazuddin, Md.] Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Ctr Global Hlth Res, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India",Desh Bhagat University; Maharishi Markandeshwar University; Sunway University; Manipal University Jaipur; Chandigarh University; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science,"Khalid, M (通讯作者)，Sunway Univ, Sunway Ctr Electrochem Energy & Sustainable Techno, Sch Engn & Technol, 5 Jalan Univ, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.;Faiyazuddin, M (通讯作者)，Al Karim Univ, Sch Pharm, Katihar 854106, Bihar, India.",khalids@sunway.edu.my; md.faiyazuddin@gmail.com,"Kumar, Sunil/GNP-6612-2022; Kumar, Dinesh/B-9005-2016; Khalid, Mohammad/V-6525-2019; Gholap, Amol/HTS-0004-2023; Faiyazuddin, Md/GRS-9676-2022","Gholap., M.

As these panels approach their end of life (EoL), the cumulative waste is expected to grow exponentially. PV recycling has thus become an appealing prospect and many research studies have been carried out to reclaim valuable materials from waste solar panels. Despite these efforts, the recovery of silver (Ag), a crucial and valuable element in the PV modules, is often overlooked, due to its low concentration. Nonetheless, it is a fast depleting resource with limited natural ore deposits. The aim of this review is to present various methods developed for extracting Ag from EoL solar modules. We have compared various approaches used for Ag recovery from EoL solar panels in terms of their environmental and economic impact. Our evaluation indicates that it is impractical to consider Ag recovery procedure in isolation since it would affect module recycling as a whole. Optimising the complete module recycling operation with appropriate Ag recovery process will provide the necessary economic incentive and promote circular economy.","[Jadhav, Neha Balaji; Gajare, Omkar; Zele, Sarita; Gogate, Nivedita; Joshi, Amrut] MIT World Peace Univ, Dr Vishwanath Karad, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India",Dr. Vishwanath Karad MIT World Peace University,"Zele, S (通讯作者)，MIT World Peace Univ, Res & Dev, Dr Vishwanath Karad, Pune 411038, Maharashtra, India.",sarita.zele@mitwpu.edu.in; nivedita.gogate@mitwpu.edu.in,"Gogate, Nivedita/AAR-6541-2020","Zele, Sarita/0009-0003-9607-1056",Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission (Government of Maharashtra) [RGSTC/File 2023/DPP - 304/CR-48/217],Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission (Government of Maharashtra),The authors would like to acknowledge Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission (Government of Maharashtra) for funding the project (RGSTC/File 2023/DPP - 304/CR-48/217) under which this work was carried out.,,119,1,1,45,45,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,1471-1257,,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

This study utilizes X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the surface elemental composition and chemical properties of nine series (S-0 to S-VIII) of Janapada (S-0) and imperial PMCs (S-1 to S-VIII) dating from 600 to 200 BCE, housed in the Numismatic Society of India at BHU, Varanasi, based on the Gupta-Hardakar classification related to the PMCs. XRD results reveal four prominent diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic silver (Ag) in the face-centred cubic (fcc) phase, with a slight variation in d-spacing (similar to 0.05 & Aring;), suggesting subtle changes in the lattice structure due to smaller atomic radius elements. XPS analysis shows the non-uniform distribution of different elements, with Ag being predominant, alongside copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and trace elements, including gold (Au), only in Janapada PMCs (S-0). The binding energy curves indicate that Ag and Cu are in pure metallic forms, while Pb exists as Pb2O3. Importantly, no silver or copper oxide peaks were detected, indicating the metals' purity throughout the coinage process. The variations in d-spacing observed in these historical samples offer a microscopic perspective into the broader contexts of ancient economies, technologies, and cultural practices. The silver content in these PMCs decreases as Cu and Pb increase across the series up to S-V, followed by a sudden rise in S-VI, which lacks Pb. The presence of Pb induces brittleness and may serve as an indicator of the coins' age. Additionally, the carbon detected by XPS could result from smelting, surface contamination, or environmental deposition. These findings reflect a high level of metallurgical knowledge and alloying techniques developed between the sixth and third centuries BCE. The varying Ag content raises questions about the economy and demand for coins. At the same time, the structural variations identified through XRD and XPS can aid archaeometallurgists in estimating these coins' chronological and geographical origins, serving as valuable tools for authentication.","[Upadhyay, Amit Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept AIHC & Archaeol, Varanasi 221005, India; [Giri, Neeraj Kumar] Indian Inst Informat Technol, Dept Phys, Bhopal 462003, India; [Prakash, Rajiv] BHU, Indian Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci, Varanasi 221005, India; [Mishra, Hirdyesh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Phys Sect MMV, Varanasi 221005, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology BHU Varanasi (IIT BHU Varanasi); Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Mishra, H (通讯作者)，Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Phys, Phys Sect MMV, Varanasi 221005, India.",hmishra@bhu.ac.in,"Mishra, Hirdyesh/AAP-3081-2020; giri, neeraj/C-2774-2013",,Indian National Science Academy,Indian National Science Academy,The authors are thankful to Dr Abhinav P Singh and Dr Abhishek Roy for their valuable help.,,39,0,0,0,0,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,DEC 4,2024,14,1,,,,,,,30190,10.1038/s41598-024-76356-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76356-3,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,O6Y0B,39632931,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001372544400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Even though values of lead and zinc can be found in a range of 2-8% sometimes accompanied by up to 500 ppm of silver, missing concepts for concentration, e.g. by flotation, and failing hydrometallurgical approaches, make an economic treatment difficult to realize. At the University of Leoben, together with associated R&D-companies, a pyrometallurgical process for jarosite treatment has been developed, realizing a multi-metal recovery and the formation of slag, allowing utilization in construction or cement industry. However, to avoid high specific energy consumption, at least a certain grade of concentration would be beneficial. The paper describes the general process idea, the characterization of the material, and the first results of mineral beneficiation trials and how they could influence the economy of the concept.","[Antrekowitsch, J.] Univ Leoben, Nonferrous Met, Leoben, Austria; [Hanke, G.] Univ Leoben, Geol & Econ Geol, Leoben, Austria",University of Leoben; University of Leoben,"Antrekowitsch, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leoben, Nonferrous Met, Leoben, Austria.",juergen.antrekowitsch@unileoben.ac.at,,,,,,,3,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-1181,2367-1696,978-3-030-37070-1; 978-3-030-37069-5,MINERAL MET MAT SER,,,2020,,,,,,,437,445,,10.1007/978-3-030-37070-1_38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37070-1_38,,,9,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,BR6IJ,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000661245700038,View Full Record in Web of Science

This manuscript aims to demonstrate that the application of metallic nanoparticles (gold, silver, copper, and zinc oxide) opened a new chapter in the treatment of wounds, as they have different properties such as drug delivery, antimicrobial activity, and healing acceleration.

In this paper, two new silver-cluster-based frameworks were synthesized by incorporating thiourea on the backbone of the tripodal ligands. Given their large pores, high density of catalytic sites, and appropriate coordination geometries, these heterogeneous materials could be used as high-efficiency Tr-activation catalysts in the atom-economical cycloaddition of propargylamines with carbon dioxide. The loading of 0.1 mol % catalysts enabled the almost complete transformation of the propargylamines into oxazolidinones at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. DFT calculations show significant charge accumulation regions with pi* symmetry on C atoms associated with the acetylene bond along the Ag-C directions and charge depletion regions with 6 symmetry along the C C direction, further supporting the important role of silver-cluster-based catalysts in pi* activation of substrates for subsequent reactions with approaching CO2. The crystallinity of the frameworks allowed the structure of the encapsulated substrates and the interactions of the C C bonds in the active intermediates to be clearly observed. The recyclabilityand high turnover number of the cycloaddition reaction demonstrate the broad potential applications of these designed materials as reactivation catalysts for practical applications in the chemical industry.","[Chang, Zhiduo; Jing, Xu; He, Cheng; Liu, Xin; Duan, Chunying] Dalian Univ Technol, Zhang Dayu Coll Chem, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; State Key Laboratory Surfactant Fine Chemistry,"Duan, CY (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Zhang Dayu Coll Chem, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",cyduan@dlut.edu.cn,"Jing, Xu/KFQ-6490-2024; Liu, Xin/G-3303-2012; Chang, Zhiduo/KVC-0980-2024","Liu, Xin/0000-0002-4422-4108; Chang, Zhiduo/0000-0001-5429-3214","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21421005, 21231003, 2150104, 21771029, 21373036, 21573034]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21421005, 21231003, 2150104, 21771029, 21373036, 21573034).

Immediate action is needed to transform the global economy towards a more circular economy with less intensive use of fossil energy and limited resources and more use of recyclable materials. Recyclable materials and manufacturing techniques will play a critical role in this transformation. Substantial advancements will be needed to achieve a more intelligent materials design to enhance both functionality and enhanced sustainability. The development of hybrid materials combining functionality at macro and nano scales based on organic and inorganic compounds, that are entirely recyclable could be used for tremendous applications. In this mini-review, we provide the reader with recent innovations on hybrid materials for application in water, energy and raw materials sectors. The topic is very modern and after its deep study we propose a creation an international research centre, that would combine the development of hybrid materials with green manufacturing. We have highlighted a framework that would comprise critical themes of the initial research needed. Such a centre would promote sustainable production of materials through intelligent hybridisation and eco-efficient, digital manufacturing and enable a circular economy in the long term. Such activities are strongly supported by current environmental and economical initiatives, like the Green Deal, REPower EU and digital EU initiatives.","[Waclawek, Stanislaw; Fijalkowski, Mateusz; Koci, Jan; Cernik, Miroslav] Tech Univ Liberec, Inst Nanomat Adv Technol & Innovat, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic; [Bardos, Paul] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England; [Bardos, Paul] r3 Environm Technol Ltd, Reading RG6 6DW, Berks, England; [Scholz, Sebastian] Fraunhofer Inst Machine Tools & Forming Technol I, Theodor Korner Allee 6, Zittau, Germany; [Hirsch, Patrick] Fraunhofer Inst Microstruct Mat & Syst IMWS, Walter Hulse Str 1, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Domann, Gerhard] Fraunhofer Inst Silicate Res ISC, Neunerpl 2, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany",Technical University of Liberec; University of Brighton; University of Reading; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Germany; Fraunhofer Machine Tools & Forming Technology; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Germany; Fraunhofer Silicate Research,"Waclawek, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Inst Nanomat Adv Technol & Innovat, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",stanislaw.waclawek@tul.cz,"Koci, Jan/HKV-2786-2023; Hirsch, Patrick/AAX-4467-2021; Waclawek, Stanislaw/K-2323-2016; Cernik, Miroslav/B-4390-2013","Fijalkowski, Mateusz/0000-0001-7595-2135; Waclawek, Stanislaw/0000-0002-8430-8269; Cernik, Miroslav/0000-0002-7554-020X; Bardos, Paul/0000-0001-5698-4561; Hirsch, Patrick/0000-0002-2711-4126; KOCI, Jan/0000-0002-9516-4942",,,,,116,3,3,0,16,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1898-6196,2084-4549,,ECOL CHEM ENG S,Ecol.

In this context, any waste can become raw material to manufacture other products, such as nanoparticles. Thus, this study aims to provide a descriptive and critical view of metal recovery techniques and later use them as raw materials for nanoparticle synthesis. After scoping searches, an investigation was carried out and found a gap in the research on synthesizing nanoparticles from secondary sources. The possible technologies to recover metals are hydrometallurgical processes, pyrolysis, and bioleaching followed by purification processes. The advantages and disadvantages were discussed. Based on this analysis, hydrometallurgical processing was identified as the most suitable method and, consequently, the most used method for synthesizing nanoparticles.

While precious metals such as silver and copper are usually recycled, silicon, which makes up the bulk of a solar cells, goes to landfills. This is due to the defect- and impurity-sensitive nature in most silicon-based technologies, rendering it uneconomical to purify waste silicon. Thermoelectrics represents a rare class of material in which defects and impurities can be engineered to enhance the performance. This is because of the majority-carrier nature, making it defect- and impurity-tolerant. Here, the upcycling of silicon from photovoltaic (PV) waste into thermoelectrics is enabled. This is done by doping 1% Ge and 4% P, which results in a figure of merit (zT) of 0.45 at 873 K, the highest among silicon-based thermoelectrics. The work represents an important piece of the puzzle in realizing a circular economy for photovoltaics and electronic waste.","[Cao, Jing; Tan, Xian Yi; Zheng, Jie; Chien, Sheau Wei; Yang, Le; Ng, Hong Kuan; Liu, Hongfei; Tan, Chee Kiang Ivan; Zhu, Qiang; Li, Zibiao; Xu, Jianwei; Loh, Xian Jun; Wu, Jing; Suwardi, Ady] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mat Res & Engn, 08-03,2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138634, Singapore; [Sim, Ying; Tay, Yeow Boon; Mathews, Nripan] Nanyang Technol Univ ERI N, Energy Res Inst, Res Techno Plaza,X Frontier Block Level 5, Singapore 637553, Singapore; [Sim, Ying; Mathews, Nripan] Singapore CEA Alliance Res Circular Econ SCARCE, Sch Chem & Biomed Engn, 62 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637459, Singapore; [Tan, Xian Yi; Jia, Ning; Tay, Yeow Boon; Dong, Jin-Feng; Yan, Qingyu; Mathews, Nripan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Chen, Kewei] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Tay, Yeow Boon] Nanyang Technol Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch IGS, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Yang, Le; Li, Zibiao; Wu, Jing; Suwardi, Ady] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore; [Xie, Guofeng] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China; [Li, Zibiao] ASTAR, Inst Sustainabil Chem Energy & Environm ISCE2, 1 Pesek Rd, Singapore 627833, Singapore; [Zhang, Gang] Inst High Performance Comp, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Hu, Lei] Tokyo Inst Technol, Lab Mat & Struct, Midori Ku, 4259 Nagatsuta, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Zheng, Yun] Jianghan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Optoelect Chem Mat & Devices, Wuhan 430056, Hubei, Peoples R China",Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of Materials Research & Engineering (IMRE); Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; National University of Singapore; Hunan University of Science & Technology; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); Institute of Science Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Jianghan University; Ministry of Education - China,"Wu, J; Suwardi, A (通讯作者)，Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Mat Res & Engn, 08-03,2 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138634, Singapore.;Mathews, N (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ ERI N, Energy Res Inst, Res Techno Plaza,X Frontier Block Level 5, Singapore 637553, Singapore.;Mathews, N (通讯作者)，Singapore CEA Alliance Res Circular Econ SCARCE, Sch Chem & Biomed Engn, 62 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637459, Singapore.;Mathews, N (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;Wu, J; Suwardi, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore.",nripan@ntu.edu.sg; wujing@imre.a-star.edu.sg; ady_suwardi@imre.a-star.edu.sg,"Zheng, Yun/J-1857-2018; Loh, Xian/H-6260-2013; Liu, Hongfei/AAR-8873-2020; Ng, Hong Kuan/AAY-2903-2020; Yan, Qingyu/A-2237-2011; Hu, Lei/AAH-3657-2021; Cao, Jing/AAC-1481-2022; Yang, Le/AAD-7611-2021; Mathews, Nripan/HNC-3573-2023; Zheng, Jie/AAI-4695-2020; Suwardi, Ady/D-1946-2019; Wu, Jing/Q-6036-2016","Zheng, Yun/0000-0003-3364-0576; Suwardi, Ady/0000-0002-7342-0431; Sim, Ying/0000-0003-0017-2630; Hu, Lei/0000-0002-4647-1604; Jinfeng, Dong/0000-0002-3026-8054; Wu, Jing/0000-0002-4182-6701; Cao, Jing/0000-0002-7853-573X","A*STAR (Agency of Science, Technology and Research) Career Development Fund (CDF) [C210112022]; A*STAR Sustainable Hybrid Lighting System for Controlled Environment Agriculture programme [A19D9a0096]; A*STAR's Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research); NEA (National Environmental Agency, Singapore); Ministry of National Development (MND, Singapore) [USS-IF-2018-4]; A*STAR Computational Resource Centre (ACRC)","A*STAR (Agency of Science, Technology and Research) Career Development Fund (CDF)(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); A*STAR Sustainable Hybrid Lighting System for Controlled Environment Agriculture programme(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); A*STAR's Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research)(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR)); NEA (National Environmental Agency, Singapore); Ministry of National Development (MND, Singapore)(Ministry of National Development, Singapore); A*STAR Computational Resource Centre (ACRC)(Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR))","A.S. acknowledges funding from A*STAR (Agency of Science, Technology and Research) Career Development Fund (CDF) no.

This trend triggers the dynamic development of the silver economy, which aims to satisfy the needs specific to this social group. One of the cornerstones of that sector concerns appropriate housing, which-as for now-is often maladapted, making daily activities highly demanding. This problem should be addressed in a systematic and sustainable manner. A current solution is to adjust the existing flats, which is suboptimal, due to high costs and technical limitations that in many cases, cannot be overcome. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a primary design of living spaces suitable for senior citizens (barrier-free flats) is more beneficial from the socio-economic perspective as compared to the adaptation of existing houses. We analyzed the economic and social costs/benefits of the contemporarily available flat adjustment strategies and the primary design of barrier-free houses. We found that the implementation of standardized design principles at the stage of architectural design can reduce yearly costs of the national economy by -PLN 385 billion (> 19% of Poland's GDP), making the universal design senior housing an efficient response to the arising requirements of our aging society.","[Malik, Krzysztof] Opole Univ Technol, Dept Econ Finance & Reg Res, Fac Econ & Management, Proszkowska 76, PL-45758 Opole, Poland; [Mikolajczak, Ewa] Jung Architekten, Grosse Venedig 31, D-31134 Hildesheim, Germany",Opole University of Technology,"Malik, K (通讯作者)，Opole Univ Technol, Dept Econ Finance & Reg Res, Fac Econ & Management, Proszkowska 76, PL-45758 Opole, Poland.",k.malik@po.edu.pl; e.mikolajczak@architekten-jung.de,"Malik, Krzysztof/AAD-9372-2020","Malik, Krzysztof/0000-0003-3107-1226",,,,,22,10,10,7,56,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC 2,2019,11,24,,,,,,,7093,10.3390/su11247093,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11247093,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC0SU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000506899000196,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reaction parameters such as PET-to-catalyst ratio, microwave power and irradiation time, temperature and catalyst recycling have been optimised. The catalyst was found to be more stable and could be recycled up to six times without losing its activity. Both the aminolysis and glycolysis of PES showed 100% conversion and afforded of bis (2-hydroxy ethylene) terephthalamide (BHETA) and bis (2-hydroxy ethylene) terephthalate (BHET), respectively. The depolymerisation of PES wastes using Ag-doped ZnO afforded BHETA and BHET for about 95 and 90%, respectively. The monomers BHET and BHETA confirmed by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and mass spectroscopy.

The site was excavated in the early 20th century. It yielded a large number of finds, including objects of silver, pewter and other metals, coins, and animal bones. The metal objects and coins date mainly to the late 10th century and 11th century AD, whereas the animal bone finds date from the 6th to the 17th centuries AD. Zooarchaeological analysis, radiocarbon datings of animal bones and stable isotope analyses conducted in this study reveal new information about religious ritual, religious change, and human-animal relationships among the Sami. We argue that there was a change in the offering tradition, intertwining with changes in the subsistence economy and especially reindeer domestication. Our results indicate that reindeer domestication, acknowledged to have had a major impact on social organization and economy, was also a major factor in the transformation of Sami indigenous religion. However, the underlying nature of the offering tradition remained consistent although the focal species of economic and religious interest changed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are more and more applications in which collecting and storing information about users (and their context) to produce classifications and predictions allows the optimisation of the services offered, improving the life quality of the citizens. In this sense, leisure cruises represent environments where it is necessary to provide quality services for a reasonable price. This requires understandings the behaviour of users both locally (i.e. each cruise) and globally (i.e. all cruises). In this respect, IoT, Big Data and Machine Learning are presented as ideal technologies for prediction-making and the improvement of the quality of services. However, on ships at sea the transfer rate of the Internet connection is limited. In this sense, Edge Computing allows taking part in the application computing to the Edge of the network, closer to the IoT layer. Data can be filtered and pre-processed in the Edge before it is transmitted to the Cloud, reducing its volume and the associated costs of its computing and storage in the Cloud. Machine Learning algorithms can also be applied to recognise patterns and anomalies on the Edge itself, even if the connectivity with the Cloud is lost. In this paper, we propose the design of a platform which aims to improve the quality of life of the elderly on leisure cruises.","[Plaza-Hernandez, Marta; Sitton-Candanedo, Ines; Alonso, Ricardo S.; Martinez-de Iturrate, Luis C.; Prieto, Javier; Corchado, Juan M.] Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca, Spain; [Kravari, Kalliopi; Kosmanis, Theodoros] Int Hellen Univ, Thermi, Greece; [Katranas, George] Cerca Trova Ltd, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria; [Silva, Miguel P.] Escola Super Naut Infante D, Henrique, Portugal; [Corchado, Juan M.] Air Inst, IoT Digital Innovat Hub, Salamanca, Spain; [Corchado, Juan M.] Osaka Inst Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Elect Informat & Commun, Osaka, Japan; [Corchado, Juan M.] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Pusat Komputeran & Informat, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, Malaysia",University of Salamanca; International Hellenic University; Osaka Institute of Technology; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan,"Plaza-Hernández, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, BISITE Res Grp, Salamanca, Spain.",martaplaza@usal.es; isittonc@usal.es; ralorin@usal.es; itulucas@usal.es; javierp@usal.es; kkravari@gmail.com; kosmanis@ihu.gr; miguelsilva@enautica.pt; corchado@usal.es,"Corchado, Juan/D-3229-2013; Rincón, Ricardo/W-8845-2018; Sittón, Inés/AAG-5827-2020; Kosmanis, Theodoros/HJY-0951-2023; Prieto, Javier/H-3704-2015; Pedro Silva, Miguel/AAG-6113-2020","Prieto, Javier/0000-0001-8175-2201; Kosmanis, Theodoros/0000-0002-8730-1345; Pedro Silva, Miguel/0000-0001-7284-4315",project ''The Surveying MARiTime intemet of thingS EducAtion (SMARTSEA) - European Commission (Erasmus+: Higher Education Intemational Capacity Building) [6121 98-EPP-l -20 1 9-l -ESEPPKA2-KA],project ''The Surveying MARiTime intemet of thingS EducAtion (SMARTSEA) - European Commission (Erasmus+: Higher Education Intemational Capacity Building),"This research has been supported by the project ''The Surveying MARiTime intemet of iliingS EducAtion (SMARTSEA), Reference: 6121 98-EPP-l -20 1 9-l -ESEPPKA2-KA, financed by the European Commission (Erasmus+: Higher Education Intemational Capacity Building).",,26,4,4,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-1627-6,,,,2021,,,,,,,159,163,,10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00038,,,5,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering,BT1XM,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000803928000027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The expansion of Europe's overseas empires and the transitions to capitalism within Europe were differentiated moments within the geographical expansion of commodity production and exchange - what I call the commodity frontier. This essay is developed in two movements. Beginning with a conceptual and methodological recasting of the historical geography of the rise of capitalism, I offer an analytical narrative that follows the early modern diaspora of silver. This account follows the political ecology of silver production and trade from the Andes to Spain in Braudel's 'second' sixteenth century (c. 1545-1648). In highlighting the Ibero-American moment of this process in the present essay, I contend that the spectacular reorganization of Andean space and the progressive dilapidation of Spain's real economy not only signified the rise and demise of a trans-Atlantic, Iberian ecological regime, but also generated the historically necessary conditions for the unprecedented concentration of accumulation and commodity production in the capitalist North Atlantic in the centuries that followed.","Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Moore, JW (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Human Geog, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",jasonwsmoore@gmail.com,,"Moore, Jason W./0000-0002-7237-9895",,,,,173,89,103,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The first step is a mechanical treatment to reduce the size of the scraps below 2 mm. The extraction of base metals occurs in a first reactor by a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide solution. After filtration, the solid is leached again with thiourea and ferric sulfate in a sulfuric acid solution to extract gold and silver. This second solution is sent to an electrolytic cell where gold is recovered as metal powder. The resulting solution undergoes a second electrowinning, where silver is deposited on the cathode. The first pregnant solution undergoes recovery of Cu and Sn. A simulation was developed using lab-scale trial results. The 350 tons PCBs/year, running in a batch operating mode, produces around 43.8 kg/year of gold, 85.8 kg/year of silver, 42.4 tons/year of copper, and 7.2 tons/year of tin oxide.

Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are commonly used to improve rate of seed germination, and growth and development of plants. The present study was aimed to monitor the role of engineered AgNP (non-dialysed) in the amelioration of fluoride (F)-induced oxidative injuries in Cajanus cajan L. Experimental results revealed that F-exposure inhibited growth and membrane stability index, while were enhanced with the augmentation of AgNP. The results also demonstrated that F treatment enhanced the accumulations of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione, gene expression of NADPH oxidase, and activity of lipoxygenase, but were decreased by the addition of AgNP. The results indicated that exogenous application of AgNP provided tolerance against F-toxicity via enhancing the levels of proline, total and reduced glutathione, glyoxalase I and II activities, and expression of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase gene. Conducted study uniquely suggested potential role of AgNP in the remediation of F-toxicity, at least in the Cajanus cajan L. radicles.

Several existing works on synthesizing AgNPs using leaves extract still involve the use of physical or mechanical treatment such as heating or stirring, which consume a lot of energy. To extend and explore the green extraction philosophy, we report here the synthesis and antibacterial evaluations of a purely green procedure to synthesize AgNPs using Carica papaya, Manihot esculenta, and Morinda citrifolia leaves extract without the aforementioned additional treatment. The produced AgNPs were characterized using the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and antibacterial investigations. For antibacterial tests, two bacteria namely Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were selected. The presently employed method has successfully produced spherical AgNPs having sizes ranging from 9 to 69 nm, with plasmonic characteristics ranging from 356 to 485 nm, and energy-dispersive X-ray peak at approximately 3 keV. In addition, the smallest particles can be produced when Manihot esculenta leaves extract was applied. Moreover, this study also confirmed that both the leaves and synthesized AgNPs exhibit the antibacterial capability, depending on their concentration and the bacteria type.","[Syafiuddin, Achmad; Salmiati; Salim, Mohd Razman] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Syafiuddin, Achmad; Salmiati; Salim, Mohd Razman] Univ Teknol Malaysia, RISE, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Water Secur IPASA, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Hadibarata, Tony] Curtin Univ, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Environm Engn, Miri 98009, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Kueh, Ahmad Beng Hong] Univ Teknol Malaysia, ISIIC, CRC, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Sari, Ajeng Arum] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Chem, South Tangerang 15314, Banten, Indonesia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Curtin University Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI),"Salmiati (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Dept Environm Engn, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.;Salmiati (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, RISE, Ctr Environm Sustainabil & Water Secur IPASA, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia.;Hadibarata, T (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Environm Engn, Miri 98009, Sarawak, Malaysia.",salmiati@utm.my; hadibarata@curtin.edu.my,"Salim, Mohd/AAM-3122-2020; Kueh, Ahmad/Z-2045-2019; SYAFIUDDIN, ACHMAD/AAF-3972-2020; , Salmiati/O-1958-2013; Hadibarata, Tony/E-1670-2012","Syafiuddin, Achmad/0000-0002-4310-7882; Kueh, Ahmad/0000-0002-3011-8611; , Salmiati/0000-0002-8914-4048; Hadibarata, Tony/0000-0002-1060-994X",Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education [R.J130000.7809.4F619]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.J130000.2522.14H40],Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"We thank the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for Grants (R.J130000.7809.4F619 and Q.J130000.2522.14H40), respectively.",,70,38,38,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1615-7591,1615-7605,,BIOPROC BIOSYST ENG,Bioprocess.

While the chemical reaction that leads from the sulfide lead bullion is identified for a long time, its reproduction in a reactor bottom furnace remains unsatisfactory and attempts to understand the transformation processes of the galena remain largely unsuccessful. This lack of mastery of the process blocks possible reflections on material balances and weight mining in ancient economies including matters related to the circulation of lead. Thus two great moments in this production line must be better understood: the roasting phase of galena and the reduction into lead. To reach these objectives, mu Raman spectroscopy provides a complementary view of the macroscopy approach to processing the silver galena especially to identify the various chemical species of lead (oxides, sulfates, oxysulfates, carbonates) formed during the transformation of galena. The transformation of the mineral occurs in the following steps: appearance of elemental sulfur and sulfates in the first minutes; reduction of sulfates in favor of the emergence of lead oxides; further reduction of sulfates with the appearance of cerusite.","[Mercier-Bion, Florence; Tereygeol, Florian] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, CEA, LAPA IRAMAT,NIMBE,CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Mercier-Bion, F (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, CEA, LAPA IRAMAT,NIMBE,CEA Saclay, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",florence.mercier@cea.fr; florian.tereygeol@cea.fr,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,6,PRESSES UNIV RENNES,RENNES CEDEX,"CAMPUS LA HARPE, 2 RUE DU DOYEN-DENIS-LEROY, RENNES CEDEX, 35044, FRANCE",1960-1360,2104-3728,,ARCHEOSCIENCES-REV A,ArcheoSciences-Rev.

Among the alternative technologies that can be used to exclude the use of toxic products, green chemistry is based on the employment of biomolecules derived from plants or microorganisms to achieve NPs. Therefore, with the aim of applying the principles of circular economy, the waste deriving from the production of olive oil represents a useful source of polyphenols to be used as reduction agents to obtain AgNPs. In our work, we employed the Olive MillWastewater (OMWW), the so-called vegetation water typical of the Mediterranean geographical area, to achieve two sizes of AgNPs, i.e., 50 nm and 30 nm. These NPs were tested on the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) using two concentrations (3 mu M and 5 mu M) to understand their ability to trigger or not the inflammatory response. This was undertaken following IL-6, IL-8, IL-5 and TNF- ff secretion and the NF-kB translocation. We concluded that the AgNPs did not induce strong activation of these pathways, especially when the cells were treated with higher dimensional NPs. Consequently, the application of these NPs in vivo for therapeutic purpose could be significant.","[De Matteis, Valeria; Cascione, Mariafrancesca] Univ Salento, Dept Math & Phys Ennio De Giorgi, Via Arnesano, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [De Matteis, Valeria; Cascione, Mariafrancesca] CNR, Inst Microelect & Microsyst IMM, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Griego, Anna; Scarpa, Edoardo; Rizzello, Loris] Univ Milan, Dept Pharmaceut Sci DISFARM, Via G Balzaretti 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Singh, Jagpreet] Chandigarh Univ, Univ Ctr Res & Dev, Mohali 140413, Punjab, India; [Rizzello, Loris] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Baldiri Reixac 10-12, Barcelona 08028, Spain",University of Salento; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la Microelettronica e Microsistemi (IMM-CNR); University of Milan; Chandigarh University; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya; University of Barcelona,"De Matteis, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Math & Phys Ennio De Giorgi, Via Arnesano, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.;De Matteis, V (通讯作者)，CNR, Inst Microelect & Microsyst IMM, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",valeria.dematteis@unisalento.it; edoardo.scarpa@unimi.it,"Scarpa, Edoardo/KII-5254-2024; Singh, Jagpreet/L-8920-2016; De Matteis, Valeria/J-4530-2019; Rizzello, Loris/HDM-2610-2022","Scarpa, Edoardo/0000-0002-5886-6929; De Matteis, Valeria/0000-0003-2204-8817; Singh, Jagpreet/0000-0002-0424-047X; Rizzello, Loris/0000-0002-8230-853X","Programma Operativo Nazionale (PON) Ricerca e Innovazione Contratti su tematiche green [2014-20202014-azione IV.6, DM 1062/2021]; Fondazione Cariplo [ERC-2.019-STG, 850936]; [2019-4278]",Programma Operativo Nazionale (PON) Ricerca e Innovazione Contratti su tematiche green; Fondazione Cariplo(Fondazione Cariplo);,V.D.M. kindly acknowledges Programma Operativo Nazionale (PON) Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-20202014-azione IV.6 Contratti su tematiche green-DM 1062/2021 for sponsoring her salary and work.

It primarily deals with developing novelty in nanomaterials by understanding and controlling matter at the nanoscale level. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most prominent nanoparticles incorporated with wide-ranging applications, owing to their distinct characteristics. Different methods have been employed for nanoparticles synthesis like chemical method, physical method, photochemical method, top-down/bottom-up approach and biological methods. The positive impacts of silver nanoparticles have been observed in various economy-based sectors, including agriculture. The scientific curiosity about AgNPs in agriculture and plant biotechnology has shown optimum efficacy over the last few years. It not only enhances seed germination and plant growth, but also improves the quantum efficiency of the photosynthetic process. AgNPs play a vital role in agriculture by having several applications that are crucial for ensuring food security and improving crop production. Moreover, they also act as nano-pesticides, providing sufficient dose to the target plants without releasing unnecessary pesticides into the environment. Nanofertilizers slowly release nutrients to the plants, thereby preventing excessive nutrient loss. AgNPs are utilized for effective and non-toxic pest management, making them an excellent tool for combating pests safely. They combine either edible or non-biodegradable polymers for active food packaging. In addition, AgNPs also possess diverse biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal activities, which protect plants from hazardous microbes. The aim of this review is to comprehensively survey and summarize recent literature regarding the positive and negative impacts of AgNPs on plant growth, as well as their agricultural applications.","[Khan, Sajad; Khan, Raham Sher] Abdul Wali Khan Univ Mardan, Ctr Biotechnol & Microbiol, Mardan 23200, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Zahoor, Muhammad] Univ Malakand Chakdara, Dept Biochem, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Ikram, Muhammad] Abdul Wali Khan Univ Mardan, Dept Chem, Mardan 23200, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Ul Islam, Noor] Univ Malakand Chakdara, Dept Chem, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan",,"Zahoor, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malakand Chakdara, Dept Biochem, Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.",dir.sajad@gmail.com; mohammadzahoorus@yahoo.com; rahamsher@awkum.edu.pk; ikrambiochem2014@gmail.com; nooruomchem@gmail.com,"Ikram, Muhammad/AAO-1085-2020; Khan, Raham/A-5272-2015; Khan, Sajad/IXD-8114-2023","Khan, Sajad/0000-0002-8079-6269; Zahoor, Muhammad/0000-0002-4528-8517",,,,,137,64,64,3,33,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,JUN,2023,9,6,,,,,,,e16928,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16928,,JUN 2023,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,O1RJ8,37346326,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001041658600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated the prevalence of encysted metacercariae (EMCs) in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from two Egyptian governorates and evaluated the antiparasitic efficacy of chitosan, silver, and selenium nanoparticles against these parasites. A cross-sectional analysis of 453 O. niloticus specimens revealed an overall EMC prevalence of 40.8%, with infection rates of 34.11% in Giza and 49.5% in Dakahlia. Clinostomid and Prohemistomid metacercariae were the most common, with mixed infections observed. Transmission electron microscopy characterized the synthesized nanoparticles, showing average diameters of 9.6-18.7 nm for chitosan, 13.2-19.8 nm for selenium, and 11.7-15.1 nm for silver nanoparticles. In vitro antiparasitic assays demonstrated varying efficacies among the nanoparticles. Against Clinostomum spp. metacercariae, chitosan nanoparticles showed the highest potency, achieving LC50 at 66 mu g/ml after 30 min and LC90 at 100 mu g/ml after 120 min. For Prohemistomum vivax EMCs, chitosan nanoparticles exhibited superior efficacy, achieving LC50 at 8 mu g/ml after 1 h and LC90 at 16 mu g/ml after 2 h. Silver and selenium nanoparticles showed lower efficacy for both parasite species. Scanning electron microscopy revealed significant ultrastructural damage to the parasite tegument following nanoparticle exposure, including disappearance of transverse ridges, integument shrinkage, and formation of blebs. This study provided valuable insights into the prevalence of FBZTs in Egyptian Nile tilapia and demonstrated the potential of nanoparticles, particularly chitosan, as effective antiparasitic agents.

The work takes a system approach, where parameters such as temperature, reformate gas composition, fuel penalty and realistic monolith samples are considered. The LNR catalyst samples were prepared by impregnation and sol-gel methods and the NOx reduction performance was characterized by flow-reactor experiments, where realistic engine-out gas compositions were used. The hydrogen feed over the LNR catalyst samples was determined via data achieved by autothermal reforming experiments over a rhodium based catalyst, using real diesel as feedstock. The LNR catalyst samples generally show an enhanced NOx reduction when hydrogen is added to the gas feed. In particular, a 2 wt% silver-alumina sample with the addition of minute amounts of platinum, shows a high increase in NOx reduction when hydrogen is added to the feed. The addition of CO, a potential poison in the reaction and a by-product from the reforming, did not show any significant effect on the LNR catalyst performance at the conditions used. This is beneficial, since it renders a CO clean-up step in the reformer system unneeded. Ammonia formation is discussed in terms of a possible dual-SCR system. Finally, the fuel penalty for hydrogen production and hydrocarbon addition is taken into consideration. It is found that an addition of 1000 ppm H-2 leads to unacceptable fuel penalties.

Governments often react by intervening against currency depreciation as, for example, in the case of Papua New Guinea in response to the commodity price shocks of 2014. We develop an original theoretical model to analyze the balance of payments impact of a commodity price shock under alternative exchange rate regimes: a flexible rate regime and a fixed rate regime with foreign exchange rationing. The balance of payments consequences are shown to depend on the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to the exchange rate. For the Papua New Guinea case, we estimate export elasticities for a variety of commodities (gold, silver, copper, oil, coffee, cocoa, copra, copra oil, palm oil, rubber, tea, logs, and marine products) as well as for imports. The results indicate that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied for this resource-rich economy, implying that exchange rate flexibility may be practicable. We implement our calibrated model to conduct a counter-factual simulation and find that with a flexible exchange rate, foreign reserves would have been 20 percent higher three years after the shock than they were under the actual policy of exchange rate stabilization. In light of this, we argue the merits of greater exchange rate flexibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents a review of copper slag as a potential resource for cobalt and copper metals for a circular economy. An overview of the chemical and mineralogical characterisation of copper slag from 21 major producing countries is discussed. Characterisation is an important consideration in understanding the nature and environmental behaviour of copper slag. Copper smelter slags are highly heterogeneous and chemically diverse. The principal slag constituents are silica, ferrous oxide, ferric oxide, limestone, and alumina. The slag also contains high concentrations of valuable metals and metalloids such as copper, cobalt, zinc, calcium, aluminium, silver, magnesium, and lead. The variation in the chemical and mineralogical composition of copper slag is mainly influenced by the type of concentrate, type of fluxes, furnace type and cooling rates during and following the smelting and converting processes. Furthermore, the various processing strategies for metal recovery, such as flotation, pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy is presented. Finally, utilisation of the copper slag waste in the concrete industry to promote environmental sustainability is discussed. This review demonstrates that processing and repurposing of copper slag waste has benefits of a circular economy such as increasing critical metal supply, lowering the cost of concrete, and reducing environmental harm.","[Phiri, Tina Chanda; Singh, Pritam; Nikoloski, Aleksandar N.] Murdoch Univ, Fac Energy & Engn, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA, Australia",Murdoch University,"Nikoloski, AN (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Fac Energy & Engn, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA, Australia.",a.nikoloski@murdoch.edu.au,,"Chanda Phiri, Tina/0000-0001-6310-4147; Nikoloski, Aleksandar/0000-0002-5267-7262",Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future Fellowship,Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future Fellowship(Schlumberger),The authors would like to thank the Schlumberger Foundation Faculty for the Future Fellowship for the financial support.,,131,89,91,18,111,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0892-6875,,,MINER ENG,Miner.

This study examines the connectedness mechanisms in the Carbon-Commodity-Finance system in emerging economies by applying a spillover index approach with the estimated vector autoregression model. Given the recent green development for tackling climate change, this study also looks into the role of green bonds and new energy index stocks in the system. Our results suggest that: (i) the pattern of system-wide spillovers changes over time and is notably driven by economic policy un-certainties; (ii) the stock market is the system's primary source of shock contagion, with green bonds being the largest shock receiver; (iii) the carbon market is heterogeneously connected with commodity and financial markets, receiving shocks from stock, silver and copper markets, and transmitting the shock to the gold market, while interacting across carbon markets directly or indirectly through energy markets, foreign exchange rates, and green bonds; and (iv) investment risk in most markets in the system can be greatly reduced by creating portfolios with other markets, except for green bonds, which are not ideal as hedging tools. These findings have significant implications for investors and policy makers in emerging economies to plan actions for asset allo-cation optimization and market risk management.","[Tian, Tingting; Wong, Christina W.

Our group has successfully achieved narrow band-edge PL by a coating with gallium sulfide shell. Subsequently, an intrinsic difficulty in the synthesis of multinary compound QDs, which often results in unnecessary byproducts, was surmounted by a new approach involving the nucleation of silver sulfide followed by material conversion to the intended composition (silver indium gallium sulfide). By fine-tuning this reaction and bringing the starting material closer to stoichiometric compositional ratios, atom economy was further improved. These QDs have been tested in LED applications, but the standard device encountered a significant defective emission that would have been eliminated by the gallium sulfide shells. This problem is addressed by introducing gallium oxide as a new electron transport layer.","[Uematsu, Taro; Izumi, Ryunosuke; Sugano, Shoki; Sugano, Riku; Hirano, Tatsuya; Motomura, Genichi; Kuwabata, Susumu] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Uematsu, Taro; Kuwabata, Susumu] Osaka Univ, Inst Open & Transdisciplinary Res Initiat ICS OTRI, Innovat Catalysis Sci Div, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Motomura, Genichi] Japan Broadcasting Corp NHK, Sci & Technol Res Labs, Tokyo 1578510, Japan; [Torimoto, Tsukasa] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Mat Chem, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya 4648603, Japan",The University of Osaka; The University of Osaka; NHK Japan Broadcasting Corp; Nagoya University,"Uematsu, T; Kuwabata, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Appl Chem, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.;Uematsu, T; Kuwabata, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Open & Transdisciplinary Res Initiat ICS OTRI, Innovat Catalysis Sci Div, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",t-uematsu@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,"; Kuwabata, Susumu/N-3492-2018","Motomura, Genichi/0000-0002-0016-262X; Uematsu, Taro/0000-0001-9415-0808; Kuwabata, Susumu/0000-0002-4606-964X","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (Grant Number JP19K05196), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (Grant Number JP22H02168), and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (Grant Number JP23H01786).

Furthermore, the obtained poly(thioether amide) possesses two side carboxy groups in each repeating unit, which can be used to form hydrogel with cationic chitosan with the aid of covalent coupling.

In recent decades, extraordinary advances have been made in this area with transition-metal catalysis, and silver-based reagents are ideal for the activation of alkynes. This high reactivity is probably due to the superior pi-Lewis acidic, carbophilic behavior of silver(I), allowing it to selectively activate carbon-carbon triple bonds (C C) through the formation of a silver-pi complex. Within this field, we have been interested in the activation and subsequent reactions of readily accessible terminal alkynes for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds, which has generally received less attention than methods involving internal alkynes. This is possibly due to the lack of suitable reactive reaction partners that are compatible under transition metals. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the factors that influence homogeneous silver catalysis and the identification of the appropriate reaction partners can provide a powerful platform for designing more efficient silver-catalyzed reactions of terminal alkynes. In this context, we envisioned that using readily available, environmentally benign, and inexpensive trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) or an isocyanide as the nitrogen-donor would be the key to develop novel reactions of terminal alkynes. This Account describes our efforts since 2013 toward the development of novel silver-catalyzed tandem reactions of terminal alkynes with either TMSN3 or isocyanides for the assembly of various nitrogen-containing compounds. The first section of this Account discusses the initial developments in the silver-catalyzed hydroazidation of terminal alkynes with TMSN3 and the subsequent advances made in our laboratory. We first describe the discovery and experimental and computational mechanistic investigations of silver-catalyzed hydroazidation reactions, which is the most efficient strategy reported to date for accessing vinyl azides. Mechanistic study of this hydroazidation reaction provides an alternative activation mode for terminal alkyne conversion in transition metal catalysis. We then present the chemistry of in situ generated vinyl azides, including one-pot tandem radical addition/cyclization or migration reactions of terminal alkynes to access a variety of nitrogen-containing molecules. Finally, we discuss the one-pot, multistep tandem hydroazidation and 1,2-azide migratory gem-difluorination of terminal alkynes for the synthesis of beta-difluorinated alkyl azides. The second section describes the silver-catalyzed coupling reactions between terminal alkynes and isocyanides, which offer a straightforward method for accessing synthetically useful building blocks, such as pyrroles, allenamides, benzofuran, vinyl sulfones, indazolines, propiolonitriles, and pyrazoles. The high efficiency, mild conditions, low cost, broad substrate scope, high chemo- and regioselectivity, step economy, and ecofriendliness of the developed approaches make them attractive and practical. The progress in this area provides guiding principles for designing new reactions of terminal alkynes that can be extended to various nitrogen-containing molecules of interest to medicinal and materials chemists.","[Sivaguru, Paramasivam; Cao, Shanshan; Babu, Kaki Raveendra; Bi, Xihe] Northeast Normal Univ, Dept Chem, Jilin Prov Key Lab Organ Funct Mol Design & Synth, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China,"Bi, XH (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Dept Chem, Jilin Prov Key Lab Organ Funct Mol Design & Synth, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",bixh507@nenu.edu.cn,"liu, zhaohong/ABH-9946-2020; Sivaguru, Paramasivam/HCJ-0226-2022","Sivaguru, Paramasivam/0000-0003-2225-0054","NSFC [21961130376, 21871043, 21522202, 21372038, 21172029, 20902010]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"X.B. thanks all current and past co-workers for their experimental and intellectual contributions to this research project.

This review aims at addressing how silver (AgNPs), titanium dioxide (TiO2NPs), zinc oxide (ZnONPs), iron oxide (Fe3O4NPs), carbon NPs, Copper (Cu-NPs), silicon oxide (SiO2 NPs) nanoparticles and quantum dots cause neurotoxicity. Some of the major signaling that occur are the signaling related to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell equilibrium, hence results in neuronal damage and neurodegeneration. It is critical to describe that there are multiple ways by how NPs may be toxic based on their size and surface, dosage, and the recipient's age and health condition. A review on in vitro and in vivo analysis provides information about the toxic potentials of NPs and preventive measures including modification of NP surface and antioxidant treatment. The results underline the necessity of comprehensive safety assessments to allow the further utilization of nanoparticles across the economy.","[Tripathy, Divya Bajpai; Pradhan, Subhalaxmi; Gupta, Anjali; Agarwal, Pooja] Galgotias Univ, Sch Basic Sci, Dept Chem, Greater Noida 201312, India",Galgotias University,"Tripathy, DB; Pradhan, S (通讯作者)，Galgotias Univ, Sch Basic Sci, Dept Chem, Greater Noida 201312, India.",divyabaj@gmail.com; subhalaxmipradhan@gmail.com,"TRIPATHY, DIVYA/AAC-7604-2020; Pradhan, Subhalaxmi/AAE-1233-2020",,,,,,132,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-5390,1743-5404,,NANOTOXICOLOGY,Nanotoxicology,2025 APR 15,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/17435390.2025.2488310,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17435390.2025.2488310,,APR 2025,28,Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Toxicology,1MH1C,40237487,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001468393200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As early as the Upper Palaeolithic, around 20,000 years ago, ochre had been mined and used for painting, while early silver extraction is attested during the Final Neolithic (early fourth millennium BC). Copper production and alloying becomes an important activity in the coastal settlements of the island during the third and second millennia. The inception of iron metallurgy has been seen in association with copper smelting as confirmed by analyses on slag found in Early Iron Age upland cemeteries. With the arrival of the Greek colonists around 650 BC, intensification in silver and gold extraction became paramount for further economic expansion. This deep history in the use of Thassian metals is being reviewed based on archaeological findings and archaeometallurgical research of the last three decades, while new analytical data on Early Bronze Age copper smelting at Aghios Antonios are being presented.","[Nerantzis, N.] 31st Ephoreia Prehistor & Class Antiqu, Xanthi, Greece; [Papadopoulos, S.] 18th Ephoreia Prehistor & Class Antiqu, Kavala, Greece",,"Nerantzis, N (通讯作者)，31st Ephoreia Prehistor & Class Antiqu, Xanthi, Greece.",nnerantzis2001@yahoo.co.uk,"Nerantzis, Nerantzis/AAI-3805-2020","Nerantzis, Nerantzis/0000-0001-6573-2518",Institute for Aegean Prehistory,Institute for Aegean Prehistory,"We would like to express our gratitude to the Institute for Aegean Prehistory for generously funding the study of metallurgical residues found at Aghios Antonios, Potos.

However, attempts to substitute or control nature through efficient bio-based technology have not lived up to expectations and much of the industry still relies on globally sourced biomass to drive the bioeconomy. This article examines the social and political economic relations surrounding small-scale production of the feedstock castor oil plant (castor, Ricinus communis) in the deep south of Madagascar. Theorizing the bioeconomy through the lens of a small-scale commodity frontier, it builds from recent injunctions by Jason Moore to show how the appropriation of cheap nature (including paid and unpaid labour) is both historically and geographically co-produced. The castor value chain is held up as a way to transform regional economies and a silver bullet to alleviate poverty and address food security in some of the most economically marginal areas of Madagascar. We adopt a regional and feminist political ecology approach to illustrate what is behind this discursive cloak of development imaginaries, making visible the social relations surrounding castor production and demonstrating the historical marginalization involved in producing the frontier.","[Neimark, Benjamin D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Healy, Timothy M.] Aquaterre, BP 1541, Antananarivo, Madagascar",Lancaster University,"Neimark, BD (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",b.neimark@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Neimark, Benjamin/0000-0003-3229-0869",National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration [9222-12],National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration(National Geographic Society),The National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration funded the work on biofuels in Madagascar (The Human dimensions of Environmental Change and Biofuel Production).

The integration of ENMs into the agricultural systems aligns with the principles of United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), circular economy (CE) and bio-economy (BE) principles. This approach offers excellent opportunities to enhance productivity and address global climate change challenges. The revelation of the adverse effects of nanomaterials (NMs) on various organisms and ecosystems, however, has fueled the debate on 'Nano-paradox' leading to emergence of a new research domain 'Nanotoxicology'. ENMs have shown different interactions with biological and environmental systems as compared to their bulk counterparts. They bioaccumulate in organisms, soils, and other environmental matrices, move through food chains and reach higher trophic levels including humans ultimately resulting in oxidative stress and cellular damage. Understanding nano-bio interactions, the mechanism of gene- and cytotoxicity, and associated potential hazards, is therefore, essential to mitigate their toxicological outputs. This review comprehensively examines the cyto- and genotoxicity mechanisms of ENMs in biological systems, covering aspects such as their entry, uptake, cellular responses, dynamic interactions in biological environments their long-term effects and environmental risk assessment (ERA). It also discusses toxicological assessment methods, regulatory policies, strategies for toxicity management/mitigation and future research directions in nanotechnology, all within the context of SDGs, CE, promoting resource efficiency and sustainability. Navigating the nano-paradox involves balancing the benefits of nanomaterials with concerns about nanotoxicity. Prioritizing thorough research on above facets can ensure sustainability and safety, enabling responsible harnessing of nanotechnology's transformative potential in various applications including mitigating global climate change and enhancing agricultural productivity.","[Rajpal, Vijay Rani] Univ Delhi, Hansraj Coll, Delhi 110007, India; [Nongthongbam, Byonkesh] Univ Delhi, Dept Bot, Delhi 110007, India; [Bhatia, Manika] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Vasant Kunj Inst Area, Delhi 110070, India; [Singh, Apekshita; Raina, Soom Nath] Amity Univ Biotechnol, Dept Biotechnol, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Minkina, Tatiana; Rajput, Vishnu D.] Southern Fed Univ, Acad Biol & Biotechnol, Rostov Na Donu, Russia; [Zahra, Noreen] Govt Coll Women Univ, Dept Bot, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Zahra, Noreen] Univ Faisalabad, Postgrad Off, Amin Campus, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Husen, Azamal] Wolaita Sodo Univ, POB 138, Wolaita, Ethiopia; [Husen, Azamal] Graphic Era Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India",University of Delhi; University of Delhi; TERI University; Amity University Noida; Southern Federal University; Graphic Era University,"Rajpal, VR (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Hansraj Coll, Delhi 110007, India.;Husen, A (通讯作者)，Wolaita Sodo Univ, POB 138, Wolaita, Ethiopia.;Husen, A (通讯作者)，Graphic Era Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India.",vrrajpal@hrc.du.ac.in; azamalhusen.bt@geu.ac.in,"Zahra, Noreen/ABF-1527-2021; Rajput, Vishnu/I-7824-2017; Husen, Azamal/C-9938-2012",,,,,,302,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1477-3155,,J NANOBIOTECHNOL,J.

This hybrid nanocomposite grafted with silver nanoparticles, numerous hydroxyl and 7C-bond containing functional groups exhibited outstanding physicochemical properties. FESEM images indicated the heterogeneous porous structure of nAg-AC, while BET analysis revealed mesoporous property with a significant increment of overall surface area (132%). Imbedding of silver nanoparticles and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups was evident from the XRD and XPS spectrum. Further, the TGA result indicated excellent thermal stability, and FTIR analysis suggested the involvement of surface functional groups like -OH, =C = O, =NH, =C = C = , and -CH in Rhodamine B (RhB) adsorption. The adsorbent matrix provided the overall mechanical strength and facilitated recycling, while the functional matrix (biochar) provided the adsorptive locus for augmented RhB adsorption efficiency (92.77%). Experiments pertaining to adsorption isotherms and kinetics modeling suggested that RhB was removed through multilayer chemisorption on the heterogeneous nAg-AC surface. The main RhB adsorption mechanism included cumulative efforts of H-bindings, 7C-7C stacking interaction, pore-filling, and electrostatic interactions. The nAg-AC maintained mechanical robustness with significant RhB adsorption even after three consecutive regeneration cycles signifying facile recycling. The nAg-AC displayed an outstanding efficacy for the real industrial wastewater depollution, indicating high effectiveness for practical environmental applications. Finally, the cost analysis (incorporating economic, environmental, and social dimensions) suggested a significant role of the nAg-AC in promoting and establishing sustainable development with the circular economy.","[Shaikh, Wasim Akram; Kumar, Abhishek; Chakraborty, Sukalyan; Bhattacharya, Tanushree] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Jharkhand 835215, India; [Shaikh, Wasim Akram] Neotia Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Basic Sci, South 24, Parganas 743368, W Bengal, India; [Naushad, Mu.] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, POB 2455, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Ul Islam, Rafique] Mahatma Gandhi Cent Univ, Dept Chem, Motihari 845401, Bihar, India; [Datta, Saugata] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geol, 104 Thompson Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; King Saud University; Kansas State University,"Shaikh, WA; Chakraborty, S (通讯作者)，Birla Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Jharkhand 835215, India.;Shaikh, WA (通讯作者)，Neotia Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Basic Sci, South 24, Parganas 743368, W Bengal, India.",wasim.bu12@gmail.com; sukalyanchakraborty@bitmesra.ac.in,"Kumar, Abhishek/ABD-3363-2020; Shaikh, Wasim Akram/ACK-6566-2022; Islam, Rafique/C-3967-2011; NAUSHAD, Mu./D-8006-2014; Chakraborty, Sukalyan/L-9607-2017; Bhattacharya, Tanushree/M-1172-2017","KUMAR, ABHISHEK/0000-0002-9777-0321; Shaikh, Wasim Akram/0000-0003-0931-3452; Bhattacharya, Tanushree/0000-0003-3547-2529","UGC, New Delhi, India; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [RSP-2021/8]","UGC, New Delhi, India(University Grants Commission, India); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University);","The authors wish to acknowledge the UGC, New Delhi, India, for providing doctoral fellowship to WAS and CIF, BIT, Mesra for characterization of n Ag-TC.

For the first time in almost 100 years since the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate, a Muslim government introduces Shariah currency. In the eyes of many Muslim scholars, the present interest-based fiat monetary system is flawed as it is incompatible with the objectives of the Islamic law or the Shariah. There have been calls for the resurgence of Islamic Gold Dinar (together with the silver dirham) as it is deemed to be the most appropriate medium of exchange to be used in the Islamic economies. Using data from 1970 to 2007, this paper assesses the empirical desirability of the Organization of Islamic Conferences (OIC) countries to an alternative monetary system (Islamic Gold Dinar) that can potentially enhance the exchange rate stability and credibility. The Structural Vector Autoregression (VAR) method is employed to assess the nature of macroeconomic disturbances among the OIC countries. Specifically, the symmetry in macroeconomic disturbances of the OIC economies is examined as satisfying one of the preconditions for forming an Optimum Currency Area (OCA). In addition, this paper also investigates the output and price responses of OIC countries of the underlying structural shocks used to shed light on the suitability of these countries to form a monetary union. The preliminary findings of this study suggest the lack of broad linkages within the entire OIC, although there exists scope among some smaller clusters for potential monetary integration based on the symmetry of their business cycles.

Additionally, the way in which economic policies changed during the Seleucid era is one of the important issues, which is addressed in the present paper. One of the methods that can help us to study this economy is the use of the PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission) analysis as a non-destructive and high-sensitivity method to identify small-amount elements. This method is used to identify the elements in the coins and to get a better understanding of the qualitative and quantitative stagnation and prosperity of the coinage in this era. This paper also investigates the differences between the amount of elements in the coins minted by four main mints in the three main geographical regions of the Seleucids in their eastern and western parts, providing valuable information about the changes in the monetary system, and the economic, political, and technological conditions of the coinage. The results obtained from the PIXE analysis of 72 Seleucid coins preserved in the Hamadan Museum showed that the eastern mints probably used different ores compared to western mints. The results also indicated that the Seleucids' policies in relation to the coinage had been constant from the time of Seleucus I to Alexander I Balas and the main changes in the coinage and the decline in the fineness of the coins by the addition of copper began from Demetrius II.","[Alinezhad, Zahra; Dehpahlavan, Mostafa] Univ Tehran, Dept Archaeol, Tehran, Iran; [Rashti, Mohammad Lamei; Oliaiy, Parvin] Nucl Sci & Technol Res Inst, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Alinezhad, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Dept Archaeol, Tehran, Iran.",Zahra.Alinezhad@alumni.ut.ac.ir; Mdehpahlavan@ut.ac.ir; mlamehi@aeoi.org.ir; Poliaiy@aeoi.org.ir,,"Dehpahlavan, Mostafa/0000-0003-0744-3587",,,,,24,6,7,0,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0969-806X,,,RADIAT PHYS CHEM,Radiat.

The Opolskie voivodeship belongs to the regions characterised by extremely unfavourable demographic phenomena. This is because some population changes here have a broader dimension than on average in Poland and in the EU. Thereby, they have far-reaching as well as complex economic and social consequences in the region. Due to the fact that demographic processes are determined in the long term, and it is extremely difficult to influence them in the short term, the adaptation of social and economic spheres and, at the same time, the use of specific opportunities resulting from these changes, seems a useful strategy for regional development policy. Therefore, in the context of senioral policy, complex, coherent and diversified activities in the sphere of growth of professional activity of elderly people, support for life-long learning, improvement of seniors' living conditions, including the development of health infrastructure, and seniors' integration in society prove to be necessary. The multidimensional concept of the 'silver economy' creates specific opportunities for using the possibilities resulting from population ageing, and minimising the unfavourable consequences of this process, in the Opolskie voivodeship. However, the implementation of this concept demands the consideration of several determinants and barriers, that consequently affect its effective functioning. The direct objective of the paper is to present the current and projected demographic situation of Opolskie voivodeship, and on its basis, to determine the challenges resulting from the ageing of society for regional development.","[Heffner, Krystian] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, Ul 1,Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland; [Klemens, Brygida; Solga, Brygida] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Luboszycka 7, PL-45036 Opole, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice; Opole University of Technology,"Klemens, B (通讯作者)，Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Luboszycka 7, PL-45036 Opole, Poland.",heffner@ue.katowice.pl; b.klemens@po.edu.pl; b.solga@po.edu.pl,"Heffner, Krystian/AAT-5557-2020; Klemens, Brygida/AAF-1950-2019","Solga, Brygida/0000-0002-5097-9339; Klemens, Brygida/0000-0002-4606-163X",Opole University of Technology [NBS 67/19]; University of Economics in Katowice,Opole University of Technology; University of Economics in Katowice,"This research was funded by Opole University of Technology, grant number NBS 67/19 and by University of Economics in Katowice, grant named Suburbanisation and the development of urban centres.

In contrary to the effect of Franco-Prussia war indemnity payment on France studied in Devereux and Smith (2007), China's post war terms-of-trade was improved. Using a small open economy (SOE) full DGE model, this paper investigates the impacts of the war indemnity on China's economy for 1895-1900, particularly issues related to the transfer problem. Our simulation results predict an improvement of the terms of trade which fits the Chinese history.

The cyclization reaction of CO2 with propargyl alcohol to form alpha-alkylidene cyclic carbonates has attracted attention due to atomic economy. Silver (AgI) has emerged as one of the most effective activators for alkynes, attributed to its distinctive electronic configuration affording a specific affinity with alkynes. Herein, two novel AgI-based metal-organic frameworks containing Keggin PMo12O40 3- (abbreviated as {PMo12}), namely, {Ag3(btap)3[PMo12O40]}center dot H2O (Ag-1) and {Ag(Hbtap)2[PMo12O40]} (Ag-2, btap is 3,5-bis(1 ',2 ',4 '-triazol-1 '-yl)pyridine), were successfully synthesized. Ag-1 exhibits both exceptional thermal and solvent stability, along with high catalytic activity in CO2 cyclization with various substituted propargylic alcohols into alpha-alkyl cyclic carbonates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The highly dispersed AgI and {PMo12} sites are beneficial for the superior performance of Ag-1, by activating the C equivalent to C bond and adsorbing carbon dioxide, respectively. Based on the catalytic results, structural analysis, and classical chemical bond theory, it is speculated that the three-coordinated silver in Ag-1 has higher Lewis acidity compared with Ag-2, making it easier to activate the substrate. Notably, the Ag-1 catalyst exhibits outstanding stability with negligible activity loss over at least five successive cycles.","[Bai, Xue; Zhu, Maochun; Liu, Yifei; Yang, Yanli; Geng, Jun; Zhang, Ange; Lu, Ying; Liu, Shuxia] Northeast Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Key Lab Polyoxometalate & Reticular Mat Chem, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Li, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Opt Fine Mech & Phys, State Key Lab Luminescence Sci & Technol, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China","Ministry of Education - China; Northeast Normal University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics & Physics, CAS","Liu, SX (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Key Lab Polyoxometalate & Reticular Mat Chem, Minist Educ, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.;Li, B (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Opt Fine Mech & Phys, State Key Lab Luminescence Sci & Technol, Changchun 130033, Peoples R China.",lib020@ciomp.ac.cn; liusx@nenu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [22371034, 22472163, 22172022]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [20240302028GX]; Scientific and Technological Development Program of Jilin, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific and Technological Development Program of Jilin, China","The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 22371034, 22472163, and 22172022) and the Scientific and Technological Development Program of Jilin, China (Grant No. 20240302028GX).",,77,0,0,4,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0020-1669,1520-510X,,INORG CHEM,Inorg.

Results show that the particle size and chemical composition of the deposited Ag/Zn and Ag particles can be readily controlled by varying the operating parameters such as replacement time and agitation. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) studies supported with SEM-EDS and TEM results indicate that the EDRR process consists of three regions: (I) zinc pulse deposition; (II) redox replacement between the Ag+ ions and the deposited Zn, formation of a Zn/Ag alloy structure, and competing Zn oxidation by H+ ions; and (III) further replacement between Ag+ ions and Zn (alloy) formed in the previous stage and possible silver reduction by hydrogen. The Zn (alloy) has a higher reduction potential which hinders the competing H+ reduction and sequentially improves the utilization efficiency of the sacrificial metal (Zn). Furthermore, by using the EDRR method, Ag/Zn particles could be successfully obtained from solutions with an extremely low Ag concentration of 0.5 ppm. The promising results demonstrate the feasibility of producing Ag-based functional materials utilizing trace amounts of Ag from zinc process solutions.","[Wang, Zulin; Hannula, Pyry-Mikko; Wilson, Benjamin P.; Lundstrom, Mari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland; [De, Swarnalok; Vapaavuori, Jaana; Yliniemi, Kirsi] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Sci, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Lundström, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland.",mari.lundstrom@aalto.fi,"Lundström, Mari/L-6106-2015; De, Swarnalok/AAW-6163-2020; Yliniemi, Kirsi/I-7897-2012; Wilson, Benjamin/A-4974-2010; Vapaavuori, Jaana/A-8702-2016","De, Swarnalok/0000-0001-9705-9946; Hannula, Pyry-Mikko/0000-0001-9844-2234; Yliniemi, Kirsi/0000-0003-2536-388X; Wang, Zulin/0000-0002-2234-7983; Wilson, Benjamin/0000-0002-2874-6475; Vapaavuori, Jaana/0000-0002-5923-0789","Academy of Finland [322214, 334818, 319691, 297962]; Aalto University; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC); Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Academy of Finland (AKA) [322214, 297962, 334818] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Aalto University; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"Academy of Finland projects (GoldTail (319691) and NoWASTE (297962)) are greatly acknowledged for funding this research.

But this Eurasian concentration has excluded Africa from the discussion. This article addresses this absence by showing that West and West-Central Africa were integral to the global price revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Considering evidence from West and West-Central Africa reveals how the price revolution was a genuinely global phenomenon, with increasing imports of locally-used currencies that created inflation in line with the inflation of gold and silver in Europe and Asia. The article argues that the coexistence of exchangeable value and other social uses of currencies also contributed to a relative depreciation in Africa's global economic strength. Also related to this phenomenon were the rise of an export slave trade and changes in the production and distribution of West and West-Central African cloth industries.","[Green, Toby] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Green, T (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",toby.green@kcl.ac.uk,,"Green, Toby/0000-0001-6296-5834",,,,,110,10,12,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0021-8537,1469-5138,,J AFR HIST,J.

This article uses the Statute Merchant certificates of debt from 1285 to analyse changing levels of commercial investment by alien and denizen merchants throughout all areas of the kingdom. It shows that Italian investment was declining from the 1280s in line with falling imports of foreign silver. It discusses the causes of this decline, and the effect on alien and denizen credit of imports of counterfeit sterling coins produced by European mints. It relates these financial developments in England, France, and Flanders to the sequence of events which led to English merchants increasing their numbers and mercantile capital at the beginning of the fourteenth century when they were first able to establish their domination of the country's export trade in wool.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford,"Nightingale, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,,,,,,35,7,8,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

For the alkaline extractions, potassium hydroxide (KOH) concentrations of 0 to 4 M were used in combination with ultrasound. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were evaluated. BIOAgNPs synthesis was optimized using the response surface methodology and central composite design. The parameters time, temperature, AgNO3 concentration, and the percentage of the biofloc extract (2 M KOH), with measurements taken for the area under the curve (AUC) (400-500 nm) and the mean hydrodynamic diameter (DLS), were evaluated. Antibacterial activity was determined for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Higher polyphenol content and antioxidant activity were observed using 2 M KOH. The optimized model for DLS and the AUC was obtained in 4 h, at 40 degrees C, using 2.4 mM AgNO3 and obtaining 2.5% of extract. Optimized BIOAgNPs had a diameter of 22.4 nm, hydrodynamic diameter of 106.5 nm, zeta potential of -28 mV, and polydispersity index of 0.26. BIOAgNPs demonstrated bactericidal activities.

Herein, we propose a comprehensive EoL c-Si PV recycling strategy with an emphasis on selective silver (Ag) recovery. Primarily, a combination of physical and thermal treatment led to the isolation of PV cell fraction from the EoL PV module. Thereafter, a less-toxic, sulphuric acid-hydrogen peroxide (1 M H2SO4- H2O2 1% (v/v %)) lixiviant was used for Ag leaching at 70 C. A novel catalytic process using platinum-embedded activated carbon (Pt/AC) was used with only hydrogen gas and air to recover selectively and concentrate the Ag+ from the synthetic PV cells leachate. Finally, pure metallic silver (Ag > 99.0 %) was obtained by the conventional electrowinning process. This study also proposes an explicit recovery process for Al, Cu, and Si. In addition, the Pt/AC catalytic process could efficiently recover Cu from the PV cells, similar to Ag. Following the complete recovery of Ag and Cu through Pt/AC, there is sufficient scope to isolate other metals like Al and Pb leaving behind crude Si wafers. Hence, the as-proposed recycling and metal recovery process is a newer approach benefiting industrial implementation.","[Yashas, Shivamurthy Ravindra; Ruck, Erez B.; Demissie, Hailu; Manor-Korin, Naama; Gendel, Youri] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Gendel, Y (通讯作者)，Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.",ygendel@tx.technion.ac.il,"S R, Dr. Yashas/JLM-7518-2023","Ruck, Erez/0000-0001-6212-8956; Yashas, Shivamurthy Ravindra/0000-0003-1776-1749",Israeli Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure [221-17-022],Israeli Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure,This work was funded by the Israeli Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (221-17-022).,,47,18,18,11,71,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0956-053X,1879-2456,,WASTE MANAGE,Waste Manage.,NOV 1,2023,171,,,,,,184,194,,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.08.038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2023.08.038,,SEP 2023,11,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,S9CV0,37660631,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001074082100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Renovating these houses suitable for LTC requires a considerable new investment. An alternative is to sell or transfer ownership of family homes and farms and buy a residential unit in a retirement community by taking out a reverse mortgage loan. We present an approach to investing in the removal of barriers in part of an extended retirement home or the purchase of a property in a Smart Silver Village (SSV) from farm transfer subsidies if permitted by the call for proposals to encourage the rejuvenation of farm ownership. Our approach includes the actuarial present value method and periodic longevity insurance premia. It also includes funds from the agricultural transfer program for younger members of farming households. Moreover, it allows older farmers to move to a SSV if they pass the farm on to their successors and receive a portion of the reimbursement from government funds. This way, they become co-investors alongside the municipality in the SSV located relatively close to their respective farms. The current retirement home location in Slovenia is quite far from the farms. Existing reverse mortgage contracts in EU member states end when a homeowner moves into an assisted living home. Our approach with minor adjustments applies to all EU Member States.","[Drobne, Samo] Univ Ljubljani, Fak gradbenistvo & geodezijo, Jamova c 2, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Bogataj, Marija] Zavod INRISK, Kidriceva ul 1, Trebnje, Slovenia; [Sethi, Suresh] Univ Texas Dallas, Ctr Intelligent Supply Networks, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, Dallas, TX USA; [Bogataj, David] Alma Mater Europaea ECM, Slovenska Ul 17, Maribor, Slovenia; [Bogataj, David] Univ Politecn Cartagena UPCT, Calle Real 3, Cartagena, Spain",University of Ljubljana; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Alma Mater Europaea; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Drobne, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljani, Fak gradbenistvo & geodezijo, Jamova c 2, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",samo.drobne@fgg.uni-lj.si; marija.bogataj@guest.arnes.si; sethi@utdallas.ed; david.bogataj@edu.upct.es,"Bogataj, Marija/ABD-1627-2020",,,,,,53,0,0,0,0,ASSOC SURVEYORS SLOVENIA,LJUBLJANA,"ZEMLJEMERSKA 12, LJUBLJANA, SI-1000, SLOVENIA",0351-0271,1581-1328,,GEOD VESTN,Geod.

Nonnative bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix), collectively referred to as Asian carps, continue to colonize aquatic ecosystems throughout the central United States. These species are r-selected, exhibiting iteroparous spawning, rapid growth, broad environmental tolerance, high density, and long-distance movement. Hydrological, thermal, and physicochemical conditions are favorable for establishment beyond the current range, rendering containment and control imperative. Ecological approaches to confine Asian carp populations and prevent colonization characterize contemporary management in the United States. Foraging and reproduction of Asian carps govern habitat selection and movement, providing valuable insight for predictive control. Current management approaches are progressive and often anticipatory but deficient in human dimensions. We define predictive management of Asian carps as synthesis of ecology and human dimensions at regional and local scales to develop strategies for containment and control. We illustrate predictive management in the Upper Mississippi River System and suggest resource managers integrate predictive models, containment paradigms, and human dimensions to design effective, socially acceptable management strategies. Through continued research, university-agency collaboration, and public engagement, predictive management of Asian carps is an auspicious paradigm for preventing and alleviating consequences of colonization in the United States.","[Carlson, Andrew K.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Vondracek, Bruce] US Geol Survey, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Carlson, AK (通讯作者)，S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, NPBL 138,Box 2140B, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",andrew.carlson@sdstate.edu,,"Carlson, Andrew/0000-0002-6681-0853",U.S. Geological Survey; University of Minnesota; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Wildlife Management Institute,U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service); Wildlife Management Institute,"The Minnesota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit is jointly sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Wildlife Management Institute.",,156,8,13,4,80,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2330-8249,2330-8257,,REV FISH SCI AQUAC,Rev.

Strong enforcement is particularly important in markets where economies of scale and network effects lead to barriers to entry and durable market power. Even when there are parallel vertical mergers, the result may well be an anticompetitive reciprocal dealing, coordinated equilibrium rather than intense competition among efficient integrated firms. Stronger enforcement would involve several steps, including recognition that claims of elimination of double marginalization do not deserve to be silver bullets and that behavioral remedies are generally unable to prevent anticompetitive effects.","[Salop, Steven C.] Georgetown Univ, Econ & Law, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Salop, SC (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Econ & Law, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,91,43,48,1,3,YALE LAW J CO INC,NEW HAVEN,"401-A YALE STATION, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520 USA",0044-0094,1939-8611,,YALE LAW J,Yale Law J.,MAY,2018,127,7,,,,,1962,1994,,,,,,33,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,GM4ER,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000438068500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This contribution analyzes the differences in the privatisation proceeds raised by EU and OECD countries between 1990 and 2000. It turns out that privatisations are part of a policy of economic liberalisation in previously highly regulated economies as well as a reaction to the fiscal policy challenges imposed by European integration and the globalisation of financial markets. In addition, institutional pluralism exerts significant and negative effects on privatisation proceeds. Partisan differences only emerge if economic problems are moderate, while intense economic, particularly fiscal problems foreclose differing partisan strategies.","Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Wissensch, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Bremen, Sonderforsch Bereich Staatlichkeit Wandel, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; Zentrum Sozialpolit, D-28334 Bremen, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Bremen; University of Bremen,"Heidelberg Univ, Inst Polit Wissensch, Marstallstr 6, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany.",rzh@uni-hd.de; hobinger@zes.uni-bremen.de,,"Zohlnhofer, Reimut/0000-0001-7808-9410",,,,,65,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0032-3470,1862-2860,,POLIT VIERTELJAHR,Polit.

The biotechnological valorization of SSL to more valuable products is inhibited by aldonic acids. Here, we discovered silver as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of gluconic acid to glucose as a sustainable strategy to convert aldonic acids into fermentable carbohydrates. A potential screening in a two-electrode compartment cell was performed and showed the best conversion at -1.56 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 0.296 mmol L-1. The conversion rate decreased with higher and lower potentials than -1.56 V vs. RHE. SEM, EDS, and XPS analyses revealed no clear influence of the reaction on the electrocatalyst. LEIS measurements indicated only ion adsorption from the electrolyte and a slight surface oxidation. The electrocatalytic behavior of silver reveals a similar trend to that of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction, where a maximum conversion is reached at one cathodic potential before the hydrogen reduction reaction becomes dominant. This highlights a key challenge in merging electrocatalysis and the biorefinery concept to create a bioelectrorefinery for side stream valorization, a crucial element of a bio-circular-green economy.

While groundwater typically is of higher quality than surface water, pollution and geologic conditions may require treating groundwater to meet safe water quality criteria. Herein, a critical overview is presented of water treatment technologies for rural and underserved communities in emerging economies that depend on groundwater. Given that small to medium sized rural communities in emerging economies often lack the financial resources to support technologically complex and expensive centralized public water treatment systems, the focus is on proven technologies that are sustainable and acceptable by the rural population. After an overview of the underlying treatment mechanisms and the principal groundwater contaminants targeted by the traditional, advanced, and experimental water treatment technologies, we identify the groundwater quality parameters that may impact or interfere with the technology performance. We also introduce enabling environmental factors that might govern the implementation of water treatment technologies in the target communities and a brief discussion of safe storage of water after treatment to underline the importance of protecting the water fromre-contamination. Our overview is further supported by tabulated summaries of the principal (dis)advantages of each technology covered herein, including cost considerations and social acceptance. Overall, our review suggests that underserved rural communities have sustainable and affordable options for cases where the quality of local groundwater resources requires treatment.","[Thomas, Boving] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Geosci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Thomas, Boving; Vinka, Craver] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Pawan, Labhasetwar] CSIR NEERI, Water Technol & Management Div, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India; [David, Sabatini] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [David, Sabatini] Univ Oklahoma, WaTER Ctr, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Rhode Island; University of Rhode Island; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Thomas, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Woodward Hall,Rm 314,9 E Alumni Ave, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",tboving@uri.edu,"Oyanedel Craver, Vinka/A-4865-2008","Oyanedel Craver, Vinka/0000-0002-7851-2108",,,,,222,16,17,6,97,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

While the general occurrence of such EOS effects has been documented for masting species, few studies simultaneously investigated how spatial and temporal variation in reproduction affects pollination and predation. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to co-occurring species with different levels of conspecific density, pollen limitation, and seed defences. Here, we use a long-term dataset with high spatial resolution of seed production of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and silver fir (Abies alba) in a primeval montane forest to investigate the relationship between reproductive effort, pollination efficiency and predispersal predation by insects. We found that, along the temporal axis, the proportion of sound (fertilized and unpredated) seeds correlated positively with annual seed production over the 14-year study period in all three species, most strongly in beech and only weakly in silver fir. Moreover, the results show that in beech, spatial seed density interacts with plot-wide annual seed rain to enhance DD effects on seed predation, suggesting additive effects of synchronous reproduction on fitness benefits. Synthesis: For both pollination and predispersal predation in beech and spruce, the strongest DD effects occur at low levels of reproduction and quickly reach asymptotes at higher levels, suggesting the presence of thresholds in different EOS mechanisms. As variability and synchrony in mast-seeding are expected to decline with climate change, EOS effects driven by DD may remain stable until the threshold is reached, at which sudden declines would result in devastating effects on the availability of viable seeds for germination and recruitment. Evolutionary benefits of mast-seeding-the synchronized interannual variation in seed production of plant populations-are hypothesized to arise from economies of scale (EOS) in reproduction, so that pollination efficiency increases or insect predation decreases when population-wide reproduction is larger. Using high-resolution (81 traps/ha) seed trapping in an European montane old-growth forest over 15 years, the authors found that EOS mechanisms vary between species (strong in Fagus sylvatica, weaker in Picea abies, no effects in Abies alba), respond more strongly to temporal than spatial variation in reproductive effort, and generally show thresholds so that little EOS benefits accrue over 20% of observed population-wide reproductive effort. These results illustrate that spatiotemporal variation in tree reproductive effort results in sequential economy-of-scale effects on early seed fate, which, combined with post-dispersal benefits, result in selection for mast-seeding in tree populations.image","[Pesendorfer, Mario B.; Oberklammer, Iris; Gratzer, Georg] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Soil & Forest Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Bogdziewicz, Michal] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Fac Biol, Forest Biol Ctr, Poznan, Poland; [Nopp-Mayr, Ursula] BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Vienna, Austria; [Szwagrzyk, Jerzy] Univ Agr, Dept Forest Biodivers, Krakow, Poland",BOKU University; Adam Mickiewicz University; BOKU University; University of Agriculture in Krakow,"Pesendorfer, MB (通讯作者)，BOKU Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Soil & Forest Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Vienna, Austria.",mario.pesendorfer@boku.ac.at,"Nopp-Mayr, Ursula/ABG-3466-2021; Pesendorfer, Mario/H-6636-2019; Bogdziewicz, Michal/J-2868-2012","Oberklammer, Iris/0000-0002-6518-271X; Pesendorfer, Mario/0000-0002-7994-7090; Bogdziewicz, Michal/0000-0002-6777-9034; Gratzer, Georg/0000-0002-6355-6562","European Union (ERC, ForestFuture) [101039066]; European Research Council (ERC) [101039066] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Union (ERC, ForestFuture); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","We thank the management of the Wilderness Area Duerrenstein as well as DI Johannes Doppler and Alexander Wilsch (both Forest Administration of Langau) for providing access to the area and support as well as DI Martin Wresowar for help in seed collection and maintenance of seed traps.

The negative self-perception of aging may lead to the negative emotions of older adults on technology, which will reduce subjective well-being and increase technology anxiety. Technology anxiety indirectly affects the intention to use digital public services, which has an impact on the intention to use through the perceived usefulness and the complete mediating path of self-efficacy and perceived usefulness.

However, it is limited in practicality and affordability by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nanoscale silver particles have been proposed as a cost-effective solution to this problem. However, previous computational studies focused on clean and flat surfaces. High-index surfaces can be used to model active steps presented in nanoparticles. Here, we used the stable stepped Ag(322) surface as a model to understand the ORR performance of steps on Ag nanoparticles. Our density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate a small dissociation energy barrier for O-2 molecules on the Ag(322) surface, which can be ascribed to the existence of low-coordination number surface atoms. Consequently, the adsorption of OOH* led to the associative pathway becoming ineffective. Alternatively, the unusual dissociative mechanism is energetically favored on Ag(322) for ORR. Our findings reveal the importance of the coordination numbers of active sites for catalytic performance, which can further guide electrocatalysts' design.","[Hinsch, Jack Jon; Liu, Junxian; White, Jessica Jein; Wang, Yun] Griffith Univ, Ctr Catalysis & Clean Energy, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Catalysis & Clean Energy, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",jack.hinsch@griffithuni.edu.au; junxian.liu@griffithuni.edu.au; jessica.white3@griffithuni.edu.au; yun.wang@griffithuni.edu.au,"Hinsch, Jack/KBA-0751-2024; Liu, Junxian/GQA-9452-2022; Wang, Yun/C-5687-2014","Hinsch, Jack/0000-0001-6897-4395; White, Jessica Jein/0000-0003-3635-3572; Liu, Junxian/0000-0002-5873-0095; Wang, Yun/0000-0001-8619-0455",Australian Commonwealth Government; Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth; Australian government; Government of Western Australia,Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government); Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth; Australian government(Australian Government); Government of Western Australia,"This research was undertaken on the supercomputers at National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra, Australia, which is supported by the Australian Commonwealth Government, and the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth with funding from the Australian government and the Government of Western Australia.",,57,9,9,0,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4344,,CATALYSTS,Catalysts,JUN,2022,12,6,,,,,,,576,10.3390/catal12060576,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/catal12060576,,,13,"Chemistry, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,2M3RR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000817621400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For A. tabacinus pellets the optimum pH values for the biosorption of Ag and Au were 5 and 4, respectively, while for C. cladosporioides granules, the best-suited values were 3 and 4, respectively. Biosorption kinetics of both metals were also studied at low adsorbate concentrations (1 mg/L) and the pH values mentioned above, and the contact times that allow maximum recovery of the two metals were defined. At the pH values estimated as optimum, A. tabacinus pellets adsorbed greater amounts of Ag than C. cladosporioides pellets, while for Au the opposite occurred. We found that the pseudo-second-order model adequately represents Ag and Au biosorption kinetics under the conditions tested.

However, bee colonies often face the threat of American foulbrood (AFB), a dangerous disease caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae (P. l.). While the antibiotic Tylosin has been suggested as a treatment, its bacterial resistance necessitates the search for more effective alternatives. This investigation focused on evaluating the potential of bee venom (BV) and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as antibacterial agents against AFB. In vitro treatments were conducted using isolated AFB bacterial samples, with various concentrations of BV and Ag NPs (average size: 25nm) applied individually and in combination. The treatments were administered under both light and dark conditions. The viability of the treatments was assessed by monitoring the lifespans of treated bees and evaluating the treatment's efficiency within bee populations. Promising results were obtained with the use of Ag NPs, which effectively inhibited the progression of AFB. Moreover, the combination of BV and Ag NPs, known as bee venom/silver nanocomposites (BV/Ag NCs), significantly extended the natural lifespan of bees from 27 to 40 days. Notably, oral administration of BV in varying concentrations (1.53, 3.12, and 6.25 mg/mL) through sugary syrup doubled the bees' lifespan compared to the control group. The study established a significant correlation between the concentration of each treatment and the extent of bacterial inhibition. BV/Ag NCs demonstrated 1.4 times greater bactericidal efficiency under photo-stimulation with visible light compared to darkness, suggesting that light exposure enhances the effectiveness of BV/Ag NCs. The combination of BV and Ag NPs demonstrated enhanced antibacterial efficacy and prolonged honeybee lifespan. These results offer insights that can contribute to the development of safer and more efficient antibacterial agents for maintaining honeybee health.","[Ali, Sawsan El-Sayied; El-Ghannam, Gamal; Attia, Yasser Attia] Cairo Univ, Natl Inst Laser Enhanced Sci, Giza 12613, Egypt; [Ali, Sawsan El-Sayied; Hashish, Mohamed El-Sayied; Ali, Ahmed Kamel; Marzouk, Wael Mahmoud; Khattaby, Ahmed Mahmoud] Plant Protect Res Inst PPRI, Agr Res Ctr ARC, Bee Res Dept BRD, Giza 12619, Egypt; [Elsayed, Hassan] Natl Res Ctr, Biotechnol Res Inst, Dept Microbial Biotechnol, Giza 12622, Egypt; [Abd El-Wahab, Ashraf M.] Thebes Higher Inst Engn, Cairo 11434, Egypt; [Abdel-Hafez, Shams H.] Taif Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Research Centre (NRC); Taif University,"Attia, YA (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Natl Inst Laser Enhanced Sci, Giza 12613, Egypt.",yasserniles@niles.cu.edu.eg,"El-ghannam, Gamal/LIC-8701-2024; Elsayed, Hassan/AAY-9116-2020; Abdelhafez, shams/ABE-7923-2021; Attia, Y.A./H-5442-2018","El-ghannam, Gamal/0000-0001-8393-0649; marzouk, wael/0000-0002-1101-2993; abdel-hafez, shams/0000-0003-2495-0484; Attia, Y.A./0000-0002-5830-2250","Taif University, Saudi Arabia [TU-DSPP-2024-150]","Taif University, Saudi Arabia(Taif University)","The authors extend their appreciation to Taif University, Saudi Arabia, for supporting this work through project number (TU-DSPP-2024-150).",,60,1,1,2,6,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 16,2024,14,1,,,,,,,19013,10.1038/s41598-024-67515-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-67515-7,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,D1T7G,39152125,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001294085700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focuses on a fault Current limiter (FCL) as one of the expected power applications. YBCO tape conductors with ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) substrate are used in this work. in order to obtain high resistance of the conductor, which is preferable to an FCL, the thickness of the protecting layer made of silver was decreased as possible. Then high-resistive metal stabilizing layer is attached on the silver layer to improve stability. Obtaining the relevant Current limiting performance on short sample experiments, model coils were developed to aim the 6.6 kV-class FCL. Short circuit experiments were implemented with a short circuit generator. The coil successfully restricted the short circuit current over 17 kA to about 700 A by the applied voltage of 3.8 kV. which is nominal phase-to-ground voltage. The experimental results show good agreement with computer analyses and show promising toward the application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many advantages are immediately evident, namely rapid and precise deposition, no waste of raw materials, thus positively affecting the economy of the process. Data for the thin films deposited by digital printing were compared with those obtained for the conventional spray method. The use of metal-doped TiO2 is also reported so that the photoactivity of these materials can be exploited even under LED light. The digital inkjet printed coatings exhibited superior photocatalytic performance owing to both higher exposed surface area and greater volume of deposited anatase, as well as the greater areal distribution density of thinly and thickly coated regions. Moreover, the presence of TiO2 doped silver increased the efficiency of the materials in NOx degradation both under UVA and LED lights.","[Bianchi, Claudia L.; Pirola, Carlo; Galli, Federico] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim, Via Golgi 19, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Cerrato, Giuseppina] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Chim, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Cerrato, Giuseppina] Univ Torino, NIS Interdept Ctr, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Capucci, Valentino] IrisCeram Grp, Via Ghiarola Nuova 119, I-41042 Fiorano Mse, MO, Italy",University of Milan; University of Turin; University of Turin,"Bianchi, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Chim, Via Golgi 19, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",claudia.bianchi@unimi.it,"Cerrato, Giuseppina/AAG-8779-2021; Galli, Federico/AAQ-1525-2021; Pirola, Carlo/O-9471-2016; Galli, Federico/L-3574-2016; Bianchi, Claudia/C-7067-2013","Cerrato, Giuseppina/0000-0001-8536-1398; Galli, Federico/0000-0002-6230-4646; Bianchi, Claudia/0000-0002-9702-6949",,,,,23,9,9,2,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Thus, in order to replace synthetic by natural polymers in multifunctional composites, this work reports on the development of collagen/silver nanowires (Ag NWs) composites for resistive sensor applications. It is demonstrated the physical interactions of hydroxyl groups in collagen with the Ag NWs and that the Ag NWs are well dispersed within the collagen matrix. Further, the addition of Ag NWs to the collagen matrix increases the thermal stability of collagen and the Ag NW content does not affect the triple helix structure of the polymer matrix. The mechanical, electrical and antibacterial properties depend on Ag NW content and the best electric conductivity of 0.0515 S cm-1 is obtained for composites with 6 wt% of Ag NWs. This composite presents suitable resistance variations under pressure and bending allowing the development of sustainable multifunctional sensing composites with antibacterial activity that can be applied in next generation touch sensing electronic devices.","[Andonegi, Mireia; de la Caba, Koro; Guerrero, Pedro] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Escuela Ingn Gipuzkoa, BIOMAT Res Grp, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Correia, Daniela M.] Univ Minho, Ctr Chem, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Pereira, Nelson; Fernandes, Margarida M.; Costa, Carlos M.] Univ Minho, Phys Ctr Minho & Porto Univ CF UM UP, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Fernandes, Margarida M.; Costa, Carlos M.] Univ Minho, Inst Sci & Innovat Biosustainabil IB S, P-4710053 Braga, Portugal; [Costa, Carlos M.] Univ Minho, Lab Phys Mat & Emergent Technol LapMET, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Lanceros-Mendez, Senentxu; de la Caba, Koro; Guerrero, Pedro] UPV EHU Sci Pk, Basque Ctr Mat Applicat & Nanostruct, BCMaterials, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Lanceros-Mendez, Senentxu] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Guerrero, Pedro] Proteinmat Mat SL, Ave Tolosa 72, San Sebastian 20018, Spain",University of Basque Country; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; BCMaterials; Basque Foundation for Science,"de la Caba, K (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Escuela Ingn Gipuzkoa, BIOMAT Res Grp, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.;Lanceros-Mendez, S; de la Caba, K (通讯作者)，UPV EHU Sci Pk, Basque Ctr Mat Applicat & Nanostruct, BCMaterials, Leioa 48940, Spain.;Lanceros-Mendez, S (通讯作者)，Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48009, Spain.",senentxu.lanceros@bcmaterials.net; koro.delacaba@ehu.es,"Lanceros-Mendez, Senentxu/AAL-9092-2020; ANDONEGI, MIREIA/GMX-0961-2022; Pereira, Nelson/AAA-6856-2019; Fernandes, Margarida/AAL-7251-2021; de la Caba, koro/K-9443-2014; AMARAL COSTA, CARLOS MAGNO/GOJ-7579-2022; Correia, Daniela M./KFS-7298-2024; Guerrero, Pedro/L-3873-2014","Pereira, Nelson/0000-0003-1293-0865; Costa, Carlos Miguel/0000-0001-9266-3669; de la Caba, Koro/0000-0002-8866-7314; Correia, Daniela M./0000-0002-3118-4717; Guerrero, Pedro/0000-0002-9785-7048","MCI/AEI [PID2021-124294OB-C22]; ERDF A way of making Europe; Basque Government [IT1658-22, SFRH/BPD/121464/2016]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [POS_2022_1_0007, UIDB/04650/2020, UID/FIS/04650/2021]; Investigator FCT [PTDC/FIS-MAC/28157/2017, 2020.02915.CEE-CIND]; FCT [2020.04028.CEECIND]; ERDF; Basque Government Industry and Education Department",MCI/AEI; ERDF A way of making Europe; Basque Government(Basque Government); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Investigator FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ERDF(European Union (EU)); Basque Government Industry and Education Department,"Grant PID2021-124294OB-C22 funded by MCI/AEI 10.13039/501100011033 and by ERDF A way of making Europe.

The framework is based on life-based design (LBD), a holistic design approach that stresses understanding about people's life as the basis of the creation of design concepts, and on the idea of service and business ecosystems as a source of multi-dimensional value creation. We connect the ethical thinking and social responsibility aspects at the core of the ecosystem concept and analyse the dynamics of home care service ecosystems from the perspective of ethics and the good life. We suggest an iterative co-design process starting with identification of change needs in service production, followed by value mapping of services, and systematic analysis of the ethical issues related to the chosen services.","[Leikas, Jaana; Sigfrids, Anton; Nieminen, Mika] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland; [Stenvall, Jari] Tampere Univ, Tampere, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Tampere University,"Leikas, J (通讯作者)，VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland.",jaana.leikas@vtt.fi,,"Sigfrids, Anton/0000-0002-3049-6620; Leikas, Jaana/0000-0001-7863-7018",,,,,62,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-50266-9; 978-3-030-50267-6,IN SY AP IN WE HC,,,2020,12215,,,,,,105,122,,10.1007/978-3-030-50267-6_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50267-6_9,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BX5GI,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001298727100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Brophy, G",,,,"Brophy, Gregory",,,Fit and Counterfeit: The Volatile Values of Epilepsy in Wilkie Collins's Poor Miss Finch,JOURNAL OF VICTORIAN CULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wilkie Collins; disability; sensation novel; Victorian psychiatry; epilepsy; sexuality,,"This paper explores Victorian culture's persistent associations between epilepsy and bodily expenditure to locate the place of the epileptic body within the Victorian 'libidinal economy'. It centres on a reading of Wilkie Collins's Poor Miss Finch (1872) as a highly original meditation on the implications of disability and visibility. In this novel, a reclusive silversmith named Oscar Dubourg curbs his post-traumatic seizures with silver nitrate, a remedy that causes a dark-blue discoloration of the skin. Behind the narrative necessity of this device, I locate an epistemological desire to render the condition of epilepsy visibly evident by saturating (and implicitly racializing) Oscar so that the inside shows through. The sporadic visibility of epilepsy confers a radically unstable identity upon its sufferer, one represented by the fluidity and anonymity of the unshaped silver and gold plates that Oscar moulds in his workshop. These plates inspire rumours throughout the community that Oscar is a counterfeiter. Oscar's valuable metals, along with his health, are stolen in one fell swoop; the thieves brutally attack him, precipitating his traumatic epilepsy. The silver does not disappear, then, but is transmuted into Oscar's affliction; these shifting metaphorical values of silver can be productively read in light of Victorian discourses of pathology, not least the widespread concern about malingerers 'counterfeiting' epilepsy. Can an afflicted body 'pass' as healthy? Can healthy bodies perform affliction? These are questions that Oscar's story raises, with the help of a twin brother who exchanges identities with him in order to retain his fiancee's affections. Collins's sensational marriage plot, peopled with a cast of 'problem bodies', pulls the novel into critical conversation with a nexus of nineteenth-century medical and eugenic discourses dedicated to the surveilling of physical difference and the 'policing' of legitimate and illegitimate disabilities.","[Brophy, Gregory] Bishops Univ, English, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",Bishops University,"Brophy, G (通讯作者)，Bishops Univ, English, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",gbrophy@ubishops.ca,,,,,,,45,1,2,1,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1355-5502,1750-0133,,J VICT CULT,J.

Simultaneously with the depletion of natural ore resources, the urban mines are storing increasing amounts of valuable and, more importantly, rare metals. To fulfill the targets of sustainability and move towards circular economy, the liberation of these valuables from wastes back to production and use needs to be improved. This study investigates the recoveries and behavior of gold, silver, palladium and platinum in copper smelting conditions at 1300 degrees C and pO(2) = 10(-5) -10(-7) atm. The investigated system includes a copper alloy with three different type of slags in silica saturation: pure iron silicate, iron silicate with 10 wt% alumina and iron silicate with 10 wt% alumina and 5 wt% lime, providing information on the influence of alumina and lime on precious metal recovery possibilities. A highly advanced equilibration-quenching technique, followed by EPMA and sensitive LA-ICP-MS analyses, has been adopted to execute the experiments. Results show that gold, platinum and palladium are recovered very efficiently in copper, as their distribution coefficients between copper and slag, L-cu/s, were greater than 10(4 )under every experimental condition studied and with all slag compositions. Silver distributed 30-60 times more in copper phase than was lost to slag. The addition of alumina into the slag somewhat decreased the distribution coefficient of silver, whereas gold and palladium distribution coefficients were increased. Lime addition improved the recovery of every precious metal (Pt unclear) into the copper phase. The concentrations of platinum in the slags were mainly below the detection limit of the used LA-ICP-MS, providing a minimum distribution coefficient of 10(6).","[Avarmaa, Katri; Klemettinen, Lassi; Taskinen, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [O'Brien, Hugh] Geol Survey Finland, Betonimiehenkuja 4, FIN-02150 Espoo, Finland",Aalto University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK),"Avarmaa, K (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",katri.avarmaa@aalto.fi,"Klemettinen, Lassi/AAA-4936-2020; Taskinen, Pekka/K-4292-2015","Klemettinen, Lassi/0000-0001-9633-7131; O'Brien, Hugh/0000-0002-7900-579X; Taskinen, Pekka/0000-0002-4054-952X",Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion and Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers,Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion and Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers,"We want to acknowledge Lassi Pakkanen for executing the EPMA analyses, as well as thank Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion and Association of Finnish Steel and Metal Producers for supporting this study.",,53,37,37,2,38,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0892-6875,,,MINER ENG,Miner.

In response, the utilization of biowaste-derived biopolymers for bioplastic production has emerged as a promising strategy within the framework of the circular economy. Although these bioplastics offer advantages such as biodegradability and bio-based origins, early formulations were constrained by suboptimal mechanical strength, hydrophilicity, and barrier properties, necessitating the incorporation of advanced additives. Recent advancements have centred on improving the functionality of bioplastics derived from biowaste through the integration of specialized additives. These enhancements, including the incorporation of functional fillers and reinforcement agents, have significantly augmented the tensile strength, Young's modulus, thermal stability, and water vapor barrier performance of bioplastics. Additionally, these additives impart notable antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which enhance food safety and extend shelf life while maintaining eco-friendly characteristics. This review comprehensively examines the latest innovations in biowaste-to-bioplastics technologies, focusing on the integration of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and physiochemical enhancements. By highlighting these advancements, the review emphasizes the transformative potential of biowaste-derived bioplastics in developing sustainable food packaging solutions and advancing a circular economy.","[Chandra, Dilip Kumar; Kumar, Awanish; Mahapatra, Chinmaya] Natl Inst Technol Raipur, Dept Biotechnol, GE Rd, Raipur 492010, Chhattisgarh, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Raipur,"Kumar, A; Mahapatra, C (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol Raipur, Dept Biotechnol, GE Rd, Raipur 492010, Chhattisgarh, India.",dkchandra.bt@nitrr.ac.in; awanik.bt@nitrr.ac.in; cmahapatra.bt@nitrr.ac.in,"Chandra, Dilip/HHC-7006-2022; Kumar, Awanish/B-2646-2018","Chandra, Dilip Kumar/0000-0001-9769-726X","National Institute of Technology Raipur for Seed Grant [NITRR/Seed Grant/2021-22/30]; Science Engineering Research Board (SERB) from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India [SRG/2022/000348]","National Institute of Technology Raipur for Seed Grant; Science Engineering Research Board (SERB) from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","CM acknowledges the National Institute of Technology Raipur for Seed Grant through project number NITRR/Seed Grant/2021-22/30.

As a viable mechanism for social inclusion and economic development, senior entrepreneurship, might bring important benefits at individual, regional and national levels. On one hand, by employing their know-how, experience, human and social capital, senior entrepreneurs are contributing to strengthening the whole economy by creating jobs for other seniors and/or their younger counterparts. They are also lowering the demand for social services, are contributing to social public funds through the taxes they pay. On the other hand, senior entrepreneurs might tend to become happier and live longer more productive and meaningful lives. Also, they have higher chances to increase their degrees of self-esteem, self-confidence and independence, to enhance their vitality and to improve their overall health. In the context of extremely scarce literature on the topic, this paper, seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the Romanian senior entrepreneurship emerging phenomenon, by outlining relevant aspects of its current amplitude. It briefly examines its theoretical background and research perspectives in Romania. The main component of the paper is focused on a quantitative approach, as an in depth statistical analysis of regional data on Romanian senior entrepreneurs' newly created companies, during the 2001-2017 period, based on recent data provided by the National Institute of Statistics.

The meat of post-sacrificial lambs went to the Eanna's prebend holding elite, while others received the meat of goats and older sheep without ceremony and on the hoof. Many assume this latter distribution worked to supply the Eanna's lowest classes with substandard meat. I argue, instead, that there was nothing inherently substandard about this meat; moreover, there is little evidence that it was intended for the Eanna's lowest classes. This paper then explores the distribution of meat to the Eanna's sub-elite, especially in place of temple rations and payments of silver.","Auburn Univ, Dept Hist, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Kozuh, M (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Hist, Thach Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",mgk0001@auburn.edu,,"Kozuh, Michael/0000-0001-8285-3186",,,,,54,4,9,1,2,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0022-4995,1568-5209,,J ECON SOC HIST ORIE,J.

The present study evaluated the effects of dietary vitamin A administered to juvenile silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). Fish were fed semi-purified diets formulated to meet the protein and energy requirements of the species (37% CP and 3400 kcal kg(-1) DE). Five vitamin A levels were tested: 1090, 1180, 1750, 2610 or 2880 IU kg(-1) of diet. The growth, body composition, metabolic and blood parameters and oxidative stress biomarkers of juvenile silver catfish were studied after 70 days. Fish growth increased with an increase in vitamin A. The fish that were fed a 2610 IU kg(-1) vitamin A diet had better quality fillets, with more protein and less fat. No effects on hematological and biochemical parameters were noted. The high levels (1750, 2610 and 2880 IU kg(-1)) of vitamin A improved the fish antioxidant defense system. Lower activity was observed for enzymes that act as antioxidants because retinoids and carotenoids acted as scavengers and donated electrons to reactive oxygen species, conferring enzymatic protection and contributing to the animal's energy economy. Based on the growth and fillet quality and oxidative results, we recommend a 2610 IU kg(-1) vitamin A diet for juvenile R. quelen.

Plant molecules that act as reducing agents are assembled in a highly controlled way which makes them suitable for metal nanoparticle synthesis. Depending on the plant species, their application for green synthesis of metal nanoparticles for diverse applications may contribute to the mediation/reduction in organic waste amounts, thus enabling the implementation of the circular economy concept. In this work, UV-initiated green synthesis of Ag nanoparticles in hydrogels and hydrogel's thin films containing gelatin (matrix), red onion peel extract of different concentrations, water, and a small amount of 1 M AgNO3 have been investigated and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM and EDS analysis, XRD technique, performing swelling experiments and antimicrobial tests using bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), yeasts (Candida parapsilosis, Candida albicans) and microscopic fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus). It was found that the antimicrobial effectiveness of the silver-enriched red onion peel extract-gelatin films was higher at lower AgNO3 concentrations as compared to those usually used in the commercially available antimicrobial products. The enhancement of the antimicrobial effectiveness was analyzed and discussed, assuming the synergy between photoreducing agent (red onion peel extract) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) in the initial gel solutions leading to the intensification of Ag nanoparticles production.","[Puiso, Judita; Litvakas, Andrejus; Adliene, Diana] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Phys, Studentu Str 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Paskevicius, Algimantas; Zvirgzdas, Jonas] Nat Res Ctr, Inst Bot, Lab Biodeteriorat Res, Akademijos Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Dimitrova, Todorka L.] Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Fac Phys & Technol, Tzar Assen Str 24, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria",Kaunas University of Technology; Nature Research Center - Lithuania; Plovdiv University,"Puiso, J; Adliene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Phys, Studentu Str 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.",udita.puiso@ktu.lt; algimantas.paskevicius@gamtc.lt; jonas.zvirgzdas@gamtc.lt; doradimitrova@uni-plovdiv.bg; andrejus.litvakas@ktu.edu; diana.adliene@ktu.lt,"Adliene, Diana/A-1139-2008; Dimitrova, Todorka/M-4158-2017","Adliene, Diana/0000-0002-8683-8757; Puiso, Judita/0000-0002-8472-5521",,,,,48,2,2,7,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2310-2861,,GELS-BASEL,Gels,JUN,2023,9,6,,,,,,,498,10.3390/gels9060498,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/gels9060498,,,14,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,K3BC1,37367169,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001015214400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By the early medieval period, 4000 years later, these animals were central to social and economic status in Irish communities and the landscape was organised around cattle husbandry to a degree unattested elsewhere in Europe. How this socio-economic importance developed is unclear. Here, using isotope data spanning six millennia, the authors identify a culturally driven shift towards the creation and management of open pastures, which began in the Iron Age, eventually supplanting woodland grazing. Cattle continued to dominate the economy until the later medieval period when a shift to participate in silver-based trade led to a reassessment of Ireland's unique human-cattle relationship.","[Guiry, Eric] Univ Leicester, Sch Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Leicester, England; [Guiry, Eric; Szpak, Paul; Teeter, Mathew A.] Trent Univ, Dept Anthropol, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Beglane, Fiona] Atlantic Technol Univ, Ctr Environm Res Innovat & Sustainabil, Sligo, Ireland; [Mccormick, Finbar] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Nat & Built Environm, Belfast, North Ireland; [Cheung, Christina] Vrije Univ Brussel, Analyt Environm & Geochem AMGC Res Grp, Brussels, Belgium; [Cheung, Christina] Vrije Univ Brussel, Maritime Cultures Res Inst, Brussels, Belgium; [Cheung, Christina] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Anthropol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Richards, Michael P.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Archaeol, Burnaby, BC, Canada",University of Leicester; Trent University; Atlantic Technological University (ATU); Queens University Belfast; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Simon Fraser University,"Guiry, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Leicester, England.;Guiry, E (通讯作者)，Trent Univ, Dept Anthropol, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",eguiry@lakeheadu.ca,"Richards, Michael/O-3717-2016; Cheung, Christina/R-1677-2017","Teeter, Mathew/0000-0002-3296-9911; Guiry, Eric/0000-0002-1467-1521; Beglane, Fiona/0000-0002-6619-0586; Szpak, Paul/0000-0002-1364-6834","Wenner-Gren Foundation; Ireland-Canada University Foundation; Centre for Environmental Research Innovation and Sustainability, IT Sligo","Wenner-Gren Foundation; Ireland-Canada University Foundation; Centre for Environmental Research Innovation and Sustainability, IT Sligo","The following organisation and institutions contributed funding supporting this research: Wenner-Gren Foundation, Ireland-Canada University Foundation, Centre for Environmental Research Innovation and Sustainability, IT Sligo.",,45,1,1,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0003-598X,1745-1744,,ANTIQUITY,Antiquity,DEC,2023,97,396,,,,,1436,1452,,10.15184/aqy.2023.163,http://dx.doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2023.163,,,17,Anthropology; Archaeology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Anthropology; Archaeology,CI0L4,,hybrid,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001124505500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

These properties include stimulated emission (lasing), coherent emission (superradiance), reversible spontaneous emission, and spontaneous synchronization leading to coherent emission. Despite the wealth of available fundamental knowledge, the commercialization of plasmonic nanoparticles in organic and perovskite optoelectronics such as light emitting diodes, photovoltaics and photodetectors, has yet to reach fruition. This paper reviews the technical challenges acting as barriers to commercialization and highlights how their solutions are influenced by economic, sustainability, and regulatory hurdles. A focused examination of technological challenges, including deposition, material compatibility, scalability, and reproducibility of the device performance, is presented. This perspective article concludes by proposing potential solutions and offering a future outlook for the field, emphasizing sustain-ability, the circular economy, and responsible electronics, alongside the continued advancement of fundamental knowledge.","[Kumar, Rachith Shanivarasanthe Nithyananda; Deferme, Wim] Hasselt Univ, Inst Mat Res IMO, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Kumar, Rachith Shanivarasanthe Nithyananda; Deferme, Wim] IMEC, Div IMOMEC, Wetenschapspk 1, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Martulli, Alessandro; Lizin, Sebastien] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Ctr Environm Sci, Environm Econ, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium",Hasselt University; Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre; Hasselt University,"Kumar, RSN; Deferme, W (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Inst Mat Res IMO, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium.;Kumar, RSN (通讯作者)，NREL, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",rachith.shanivarasanthe@uhasselt.be; wim.deferme@uhasselt.be,"deferme, wim/K-3946-2019; Lizin, Sebastien/AGF-1544-2022",,UHasselt BOF [BOF21KP04],UHasselt BOF,The authors would like to thank the UHasselt BOF funding grant number BOF21KP04 for supporting the work.,,246,0,0,12,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0079-6425,1873-2208,,PROG MATER SCI,Prog.

Existing scholarship has overlooked the impact of the trade regime shift and the development of the foreign exchange market during the nineteenth century. This study investigates the effects of changing trade relationships and the growth of the exchange rate system between Southeast Asia and China. Using newly arranged trade and remittance data, a series of analyses demonstrate that the pre-1870 remittances via Singapore (the most thriving trade and financial hub) were practised through investments in profitable exports of Southeast Asian products. Moreover, this study identifies the post-1870 shift of Singapore-China trade balances from a surplus to a deficit. This was owing to the rise of the colonial export economy and the expansion of Chinese immigration in British Malaya. Thus, the conventional remittance mode was no longer effective. Meanwhile, foreign exchange transactions between Singapore and Hong Kong became more reliable and efficient from the 1870s onwards. Chinese remitters then merged exchange dealings into their businesses and emerged as large-scale remittance agencies.","[Kobayashi, Atsushi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1 Furou chou, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Nagoya University,"Kobayashi, A (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1 Furou chou, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",akoba@nagoya-u.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This study was presented at the Session Transnational Migration and Diasporic Memories at the Association for Asian Studies, Annual Conference in Honolulu in March 2022, the Transregional East Asia Reading Group at the University of Cambridge in March 2023, and the Public Lecture in Faculty of Economics, Chulalongkorn University in March 2024.

In this paper, we will test the hypothesis that the adoption of a ?PanEuropean? currency has favoured the development of such a network. We define a methodology to test the money-hypothesis in pre-literate economies, based on analogies with the material characters of metallic money in the Ancient Near East. The statistical properties of metals from European hoards are compared with those of balance weights, in order to test the following expectation: if they were used as money, complete objects and fragments are expected to comply with standard weight systems. The results meet the expectation, and indicate that bronze fragments possess the same statistical properties as hack-silver money in the Ancient Near East. The sample includes approximately 3000 metal objects, collected from two test-areas: Italy and Central Europe.

Moreover, gold and silver are argued to hedge the stock and cryptocurrency markets during market downsides. Therefore, accurate forecasting of crude oil and precious metals prices is critical. Nevertheless, due to the nonlinear nature, substantial fluctuations, and irregular cycles of crude oil and precious metals, predicting their prices is a challenging task. Our study contributes to the commodity market price forecasting literature by implementing and comparing advanced deep-learning models. We address this gap by including silver alongside gold in our analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the precious metal markets. This research expands existing knowledge and provides valuable insights into predicting commodity prices. In this study, we implemented 16 deep- and machine-learning models to forecast the daily price of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, gold, and silver markets. The employed deep-learning models are long short-term memory (LSTM), BiLSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU), bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), T2V-BiLSTM, T2V-BiGRU, convolutional neural networks (CNN), CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiGRU, temporal convolutional network (TCN), TCN-BiLSTM, and TCN-BiGRU. We compared the forecasting performance of deep-learning models with the baseline random forest, LightGBM, support vector regression, and k-nearest neighborhood models using mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error, and root mean squared error as evaluation criteria. By considering different sliding window lengths, we examine the forecasting performance of our models. Our results reveal that the TCN model outperforms the others for WTI, Brent, and silver, achieving the lowest MAE values of 1.444, 1.295, and 0.346, respectively. The BiGRU model performs best for gold, with an MAE of 15.188 using a 30-day input sequence. Furthermore, LightGBM exhibits comparable performance to TCN and is the best-performing machine-learning model overall. These findings are critical for investors, policymakers, mining companies, and governmental agencies to effectively anticipate market trends, mitigate risk, manage uncertainty, and make timely decisions and strategies regarding crude oil, gold, and silver markets.","[Foroutan, Parisa; Lahmiri, Salim] Concordia Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Lahmiri, S (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Supply Chain & Business Technol Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",salim.lahmiri@concordia.ca,,,,,,,110,4,4,21,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2199-4730,,FINANC INNOV,Financ.

In this study, bimetallic nanoparticles were produced using extracts derived from Cannabis sativa and Vitis vinifera waste, focusing on their green synthesis and antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, specifically several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The Vitis vinifera canes and post-extraction waste from Cannabis sativa were processed using an ethanol extraction method. The extract was then mixed with silver nitrate and tetrachloroauric acid solution at different reagent ratios to optimize the synthesis process. The resulting bimetallic nanoparticles (AgAuNPs) were characterized using UV-vis spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of the biosynthesized AgAuNPs was evaluated against various strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using a microcultivation device, and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined through subsequent solid medium cultivation. Additionally, the minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) was assessed using a polystyrene microtiter plate as biofilm carrier and measured through an assay determining the metabolic activity of biofilm cells. The results demonstrated successful synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles using the extracts from Cannabis sativa and Vitis vinifera waste. The AgAuNPs exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the tested Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, inhibiting their growth and biofilm formation. These findings highlight the potential of waste valorization and circular economy in nanoparticle production and their application as effective antimicrobial agents. This study contributes to the growing field of sustainable nanotechnology and provides insights into the utilization of plant waste extracts for the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties. The findings support the development of eco-friendly and cost-effective approaches for nanoparticle production while addressing the challenges of waste management and combating microbial infections.","[Michailidu, Jana; Miskovska, Anna; Jarosova, Irena; Cejkova, Alena; Mat'atkova, Olga] UCT Prague, Tech 5,Dejvice, Prague 6, Czech Republic","University of Chemistry & Technology, Prague","Michailidu, J (通讯作者)，UCT Prague, Tech 5,Dejvice, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",,"Čejková, Alena/AAC-7125-2021; Kolouchova, Irena/F-8963-2019; Matatkova, Olga/K-3262-2015","Matatkova, Olga/0000-0002-3646-9738; Michailidu, Jana/0000-0003-2679-2408; Cejkova, Alena/0000-0002-4289-7894; Miskovska, Anna/0000-0002-1510-4617",,,,,54,5,5,1,5,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,2046-2069,,RSC ADV,RSC Adv.,FEB 7,2024,14,8,,,,,5309,5318,,10.1039/d3ra07134k,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3ra07134k,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,HJ2K7,38343999,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001159065400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study analyzes the construction material flow and stock trends that shaped and were shaped by the development, decline, and renewal of the Tiexi district of Shenyang, a microcosm of China's urban transformations since the early 20th century. Chronicling building-by-building the material flows and stock accumulations involved in the buildup of this area, we shed light on the physical resource context of its socioeconomic history. We find that 42 million tonnes of construction materials were needed to develop the Tiexi district from 1910 to 2018, and 18 million tonnes of material outflows were generated by end-of-life building demolition. However, over 55% of inflows and 93% of outflows occurred since 2002 during a complete redevelopment of the district. Only small portions of end-of-life materials could have been reused or recycled because of temporal and typological mismatches of supply and demand and technical limitations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic decrease in median building lifetimes to as low as 6 years in the early 21st century. These findings contribute to the discussion of long-term environmental efficiency and sustainability of societal development through construction and reflect on the challenges of urban renewal processes not only in China but also in other developing and developed countries that lost (or may lose) their traditional economic base and restructure their urban forms.

We use the time-frequency domain spillover index methodology of Barunik and Krehlik (2018). The results show that the UK stock market is the largest contributor to and receipt of short-term spillovers. Gold, palladium, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bulgarian, Mexican, and Russian stock markets are the next receivers of spillover. German and Australian stock markets are, respectively, the largest source and receipt of spillovers in the long term. Furthermore, the spillovers in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term, and they are more pronounced during the global financial crisis (GFC). Precious metals contribute more to the forecasting variance for stock markets in the top precious metal exporter economies than in the top precious metal importer economies. They receive more spillovers from stock markets in the top precious metal exporters irrespective of time horizons. In addition, the spillover effects in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term in top precious metal exporters. Precious metals provide a better hedging effectiveness than individual equity portfolios.

As such, the circular economy can be a long-term strategy to mitigate the risks of critical raw material (CRM) supply. Tantalum, with a current end-of-life recycling rate of less than 1%, has been intermittently discussed as critical. Even though the specificity of tantalum applications and high-mass fractions of tantalum in relevant components provide good boundary conditions, recycling barriers hinder the successful implementation of recycling technologies. With this case study, we identify potentials and barriers for implementing the recovery of CRM, using the example of tantalum. To this end, information about visually identifiable tantalum capacitors (VICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) in various equipment types was obtained by disassembly campaigns for mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, notebooks, desktop personal computers, flat screen monitors, servers, etc., and the chemical analyses of resulting fractions. Results show great differences in the application of tantalum in various equipment types. Because of this, the tantalum potential of put-on-market (POM) or of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) devices differs between products and regions. Worldwide, the highest POM tantalum flows originate from desktop computers, but in Germany they originate from notebooks. A focus on particular products leads to higher yields in recycling and supports circular economy approaches. Recycling of tantalum from WEEE is generally possible. But an accurate separation of tantalum from PCBs is not feasible solely by separation of VICs. This process also leads to the loss of silver. Further, this study reveals potential miniaturization trends, decreasing the use of VICs, with an anticipated substitution of tantalum with niobium. These barriers impede long-term recycling strategies for tantalum aimed at establishing a circular economy.","[Ueberschaar, Maximilian; Jalalpoor, Daniel Dariusch; Korf, Nathalie; Rotter, Vera Susanne] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Environm Technol, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Rotter, VS (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Environm Technol, Off Z2, Chair Circular Econ & Recycling Technol, Str 17,Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",vera.rotter@tu-berlin.de,"Korf, Nathalie/T-4107-2019; Rotter, Vera/AAH-8287-2021",,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (UPgrade-Project) [033R087A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (UPgrade-Project),This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (UPgrade-Project reference number 033R087A).,,42,37,38,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

Sea otter pelts were a commodity directly linked to the creation of a Pacific Ocean economy, and California's colonization resulted from imperial dynamics to which this trade gave rise. Methodology: Using both primary and secondary sources, we examine how these merchants' quest to supply the lucrative Chinese luxury market with furs-soft gold-brought them into contact with indigenous peoples whose livelihoods and commercial networks would also be recruited into this global market but on quite unequal terms and with devastating consequences. Originality: The growth of this Pacific trade throughout the eighteenth century fueled geopolitical rivalries that led to the colonization of California with a system of missions and military garrisons (presidios) and, eventually, to a new ecology as a result of plants and animals brought from New Spain before the Gold Rush and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Many, including Marx and Engels, have claimed that the Gold Rush contributed significantly to the dynamics of industrial capitalism; nevertheless, we argue that its conditions of possibility were laid out centuries earlier via the complex geopolitical and ecological connections through which this Pacific economy was articulated. Conclusions: During the eighteenth century, the Pacific's products were extracted and commodified in circuits whose demand center was China. It is precisely the prior existence of these global markets-centered on silver and soft gold, or sea otter furs-that explains the presence of Europeans and Americans in California eager to prospect for the yellow metal in 1848.","[Giraldez, Arturo] Univ Pacific, Spanish & Int Studies, Stockton, CA 95211 USA; [Richard, Analiese] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Cuajimalpa, Humanities, Mexico City, Mexico",University of the Pacific; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; University Autonoma Metropolitana Cuajimalpa,"Giráldez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pacific, Spanish & Int Studies, Stockton, CA 95211 USA.",agiralde@pacific.edu; arichard@cua.uam.mx,"Richard, Analiese/AAQ-5293-2021","Richard, Analiese/0000-0001-6061-7959",,,,,52,0,0,1,2,UNIV ANDES,Bogota,"Cra. 1 #18a-12, Bogota, COLOMBIA",0121-1617,1900-6152,,HIST CRITICA,Hist.

Even though, one of the major challenges which has seriously influenced the economic loss of horticulture is rooting of cuttings and root growth inhibiting plant pathogens. To address this issue through nanobiotechnology, we ingeniously build a concept of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as nanobullets can act for a dual mode like root enhancer and pathogen destroyer on the target site. After that, we succeeded in AgNPs synthesis, using two auxin rooting hormones of Indole-3-acetic acid and Indole-3-butyric acid as a reducing cum stabilizing agent. Further, its efficacy of root promoting and pathogen inhibitory action was sufficiently validated through in vitro and ex vitro studies with model plants and plant pathogens. As a result, the action duality of hormone-stabilized AgNPs was manifested to threefold enhanced root growth compared to controls and it increased the rooting capabilities against root growth inhibiting phytopathogens. This feature was also proved by the direct antifungal assay. Moreover, hormone-AgNPs left no toxicity to treated plants which was revealed by RAPD molecular markers. Therefore, with a detailed study and analysis with instruments such as Spectroscopy, TEM, Zetasizer, FTIR, Cyclic Voltammetry, Fluorescence microscopy (nanoparticles uptake), SEM coupled with EDS (bioaccumulation), TGA (grafting density) and PCR (RAPD analysis), this study can unravel the relevance, scope and current challenges at horticulture plants root development and plant disease management for the sustainable agricultural crop production.

This study introduces a novel approach for fabrication of antimicrobial porous composite of polypropylene (PP) including utilizing a green synthesis method for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The PP waste was transformed into an emulsion-templated porous matrix, which was subsequently grafted with acrylic acid (AA) via a Fenton reaction to achieve a maximum of similar to 26 % degree of grafting. The resulting PP-g-AA matrix exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity and was characterized by FTIR, XPS, and FESEM. The AgNPs were synthesized using the root extract of Nyctanthes arbortristis plant. The AgNPs were characterized for their size, morphology, and stability using UV-Vis, DLS, and TEM. The AgNPs were then immobilized onto the grafted PP matrix, forming PP-g-AA-Ag composites. The antimicrobial efficacy of these composite was evaluated against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylo aureus (S. aureus). The PP-g-AA-Ag composite exhibited significant antibacterial activity, with the smaller-sized AgNPs showing higher efficacy (99.35 % for E.coli and 99.55 % for S. aureus) as compared to larger-sized AgNPs (97.55 % for E.coli and 98.05 % for S. aureus). The bacterial reduction percentages and zone of inhibition (ZOI) values were determined, affirming the enhanced antimicrobial properties of the PP-g-AA-Ag composites. The combination of porous PP, acrylic acid grafting, and green-synthesized AgNPs offers a versatile platform for mitigating bacterial growth, contributing to the ongoing efforts to address global health challenges and plastic waste management.","[Rani, Sweety; Mathew, Blesson Tom; Kumar, Dheeraj; Nandan, Bhanu; Srivastava, Rajiv K.] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Text & Fibre Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Srivastava, RK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Text & Fibre Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",rajiv@iitd.ac.in,"Rani, Sweety/MGB-4763-2025",,Commission (UGC) [DEC18-115723],Commission (UGC),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and the University Grants Commission (UGC grant DEC18-115723 to SR) to perform this research work.,,66,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2468-0230,,,SURF INTERFACES,Surf.

Different anti-coccidial drugs (diclazuril, amprolium, halofuginone, ionophores, sulphaquinoxaline, clopidol, and ethopabate) and vaccines have been used for their control. Still, due to the development of resistance, their efficacy has been limited. It is continuously damaging the economy of the poultry industry because under its control, almost $14 billion is spent, globally. Recent research has been introducing better and more effective control of coccidiosis by using metallic and metallic oxide nanoparticles. Zinc, zinc oxide, copper, copper oxide, silver, iron, and iron oxide are commonly used because of their drug delivery mechanism. These nanoparticles combined with other drugs enhance the effect of these drugs and give their better results. Moreover, by using nanotechnology, the resistance issue is also solved because by using several mechanisms at a time, protozoa cannot evolve and thus resistance cannot develop.

J,"Biggs, N",,,,"Biggs, Norman",,,Thomas Harriot on the coinage of England,ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Thomas Harriot was the finest English mathematician before Isaac Newton, but his work on the coinage of his country is almost unknown, unlike Newton's. In the early 1600s Harriot studied several aspects of the gold and silver coins of his time. He investigated the ratio between the values of gold and silver, using data derived from the official weights of the coins; he used hydrostatic weighing to determine the composition of the coins; and he studied the methods used to calculate how metals should be combined in order to produce the required standard of purity. This work required not only arithmetical skill, but also great insight into the relationships between the various quantities, and here his greate invention of algebra' played its part. The gold and silver coins were critically important in the national economy at that time, because they had intrinsic value and represented the country's store of wealth. In his lifetime Harriot was supported by the patronage of Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, who was a member of the Privy Council in 1604 when great changes to the English coinage were being made. After Harriot's death his papers remained under the control of one of his executors, Sir Thomas Aylesbury, who became Master of the Tower Mint in 1635. These facts suggest that his work on the coins was considered to be important for practical reasons, not just academic ones. In this article the interplay between the scholarly work and its application to matters of national significance will be analysed in depth. The conclusions also throw some light on the long-standing mystery surrounding the fate of Harriot's papers.","[Biggs, Norman] London Sch Econ, Dept Math, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Biggs, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Math, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",nlbiggs@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,6,6,2,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0003-9519,1432-0657,,ARCH HIST EXACT SCI,Arch.

Efficient recovery of Ag from waste streams is critical to mitigate environmental impacts and promote the circular economy as it can be found in a large majority of all electronic components, due to its favorable electrical properties. In this study, we present an innovative integration of ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide ([TBPH][OH]), with metal-organic framework MOF-74 (Mg) in thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes for enhanced Ag recovery. The encapsulation of ILs in MOF-74 (Mg) addresses key challenges such as IL instability and detachment, while utilizing the high porosity, hydro stability, and coordinative unsaturated sites of the MOF to improve overall membrane performance. The resulting IL-MOF TFN membrane demonstrates superior selectivity, stability, and efficiency in the recovery of Ag (99.4%) from Ag-bearing solution leachated ceramic capacitors. This work highlights a synergistic approach combining the unique properties of ILs and MOFs to develop sustainable and high performance solutions for metal recovery applications.","[Han, Bo; Xia, Dong; Yan, Qingyu; Gabriel, Jean-Christophe P.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Energy Res Inst NTU ERIN, SCARCE Lab, Singapore 637459, Singapore; [Liu, Ziyang; Yan, Qingyu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zante, Guillaume; Gabriel, Jean-Christophe P.] Univ Paris Saclay, LICSEN, NIMBE, CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Han, B; Gabriel, JCP (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Energy Res Inst NTU ERIN, SCARCE Lab, Singapore 637459, Singapore.;Gabriel, JCP (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, LICSEN, NIMBE, CNRS, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",han.bo@ntu.edu.sg; jean-christophe.gabriel@cea.fr,"Gabriel, Jean-Christophe/H-9959-2014; Yan, Qingyu/A-2237-2011",,"SCARCE project; National Research Foundation; Prime Minister's Office, Singapore; Ministry of National Development, Singapore; National Environment Agency, Singapore [CTRL-2023-1D-01]; Ministry of the Environment and Water Resource, Singapore, Urban Solutions & Sustainability - Integration Fund [USS-IF-2018-4]; National Research Foundation, Singapore","SCARCE project; National Research Foundation; Prime Minister's Office, Singapore; Ministry of National Development, Singapore(Ministry of National Development, Singapore); National Environment Agency, Singapore; Ministry of the Environment and Water Resource, Singapore, Urban Solutions & Sustainability - Integration Fund; National Research Foundation, Singapore(National Research Foundation, Singapore)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the SCARCE project, which (i) phase 1 (2018-2023) was supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, the Ministry of National Development, Singapore, National Environment Agency, Singapore, and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resource, Singapore under the Closing the Waste Loop R&D Initiative as part of the Urban Solutions & Sustainability - Integration Fund [Award No. USS-IF-2018-4] and; (ii) Phase 2 is currently supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and National Environment Agency, Singapore under its Closing the Waste Loop Funding Initiative (Award No. CTRL-2023-1D-01).",,64,1,1,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1383-5866,1873-3794,,SEP PURIF TECHNOL,Sep.

This article presents the results of work aimed at obtaining bionanocomposite materials based on bacterial cellulose, a natural and eco-friendly material. Bacterial cellulose obtained from the Kombucha symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) fermentation process is functionalized by embedding with diatom frustules, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The effects of functionalization on mechanical, optical, plasmonic, electrical, chemiluminescent, and antimicrobial properties are evaluated. Morphological characteristics of the nanocomposites are studied using electron microscopy. Addition of diatom frustules introduced into the SCOBY culture media results in bionanocomposite materials with enhanced tensile strength and increased ultraviolet (UV) blockage properties. In situ functionalization of bacterial cellulose with AgNPs tunes plasmonic and chemiluminescent properties, revealing the biosensing potential of the material. Modified bacterial cellulose shows antimicrobial activity in experiments with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Dual functionalization of bacterial cellulose with PEDOT:PSS and AgNPs results in improved electrical conductivity of the bionanocomposite. Overall, bottom-up physical functionalization approaches and the resulting bionanocomposite materials will open up new opportunities for the low-cost production of green materials and contribute to the development of a sustainable economy.

In order to help meet future global Ag demands and prevent contamination of the environment, all the Ag from end-of-life modules must be recovered instead of landfilled. The most mature Ag recycling recipes use high concentration nitric acid (HNO3) solutions often in combination with heating and agitation. After the Ag is leached, chemical precipitation or electrochemistry is used to recover metallic Ag. However, the process of Ag leaching in the HNO3 system with competing elements from silicon solar cells is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics governing Ag leaching in low-concentration HNO3 without agitation or heating to expand fundamental knowledge in support of Ag recovery efforts from end-of-life solar panels. ICPOES is used to quantify the amount of Ag leached in the HNO3 solution over time. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) are used to study the changes on the silicon solar cell surface.

A tangible material in this whole exercise; the humble, everyday 'brick'became the symbol of nationalism. While this building material holds such a shiny political campaign in the form of a silver brick today, the on-ground situation of brick kilns is rather grim, which exploits labour and deteriorates the environment. To change this scenario there needs to be change in policy that includes an array of solutions for brick making, including Stabilised Compressed Earth Blocks, adobe etc. To keep a check on these ecological imbalances, firstly at policy level intervention, the government should initiate decentralised, smaller and regional production systems instead of global chains. Secondly, alternate construction materials should be made mainstream, and an array of innovative local technologies should be incorporated instead of propagating one chief solution, universally, for brick production. Absence of environmental emission policies and regulatory enforcement leave no incentive for brick manufacturers to adopt less polluting industries and the added lack of policies that address the demand-side issues, even though appropriate technologies may be present, make it worse. There is an urgent need to revamp the brick industry of the world, especially in the emerging economies where the next decades will see exponential growth.","[Joseph, Priya] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal, India",Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE),"Joseph, P (通讯作者)，Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal, India.",priyajoseph2002@gmail.com,"Joseph, Priya/HZJ-7995-2023",,,,,,17,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-5069,1753-5077,,URBAN RES PRACT,Urban Res.

This suggests that other alternative materials and methods could also be used in standard procedures for toxicity testing. The guidelines also favor using less time-consuming procedures and reducing costs and other limitations to ecotoxicological assessments. In recent years, spent coffee grounds (SCG) have been used to produce vermicompost and biochar and as an additive to organic fertilizers. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics of SCG indicate that the material is a suitable substrate for earthworms, with the organisms performing as well as in natural soil. In the present study, a battery of ecotoxicological tests was established with unwashed and washed SCG and a natural reference soil (LUFA 2.2). The test substrates were spiked with different concentrations of silver nitrate. Survival and reproduction of the earthworm E. andrei were assessed under different conditions, along with substrate basal respiration (SBR) as a proxy for microbial activity. Seedling emergence and the germination index of Lepidium sativum were also determined, following standard guidelines. Exposure to silver nitrate had similar effects on earthworm survival and reproduction, as the estimated effective concentrations (EC10 and EC50) in unwashed SCG and LUFA 2.2 overlapped. A hormetic effect was observed for SBR in LUFA 2.2 spiked with 12.8 mg/kg but not in unwashed SCG. Both SBR and root development were inhibited by similar concentrations of silver nitrate in washed SCG. The findings indicate that unwashed SCG could potentially be used as a substrate in E. andrei toxicity tests and support the eventual inclusion of this material in the standard guidelines.","[Mendes, Luis Andre; Dominguez, Jorge] Univ Vigo, Grp Ecoloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Mendes, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Grp Ecoloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",luisandre.limagamamendes@uvigo.gal; jdguez@uvigo.es,"Domínguez, Jorge/T-7647-2019; Mendes, Luis Andre/D-7990-2014","Mendes, Luis Andre/0000-0002-4573-8290",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacin,Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacin,No Statement Available,,42,0,0,1,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

To this end, leaching experiments with heterotrophs (Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis and Penicillium simplicissimum) were carried out. The heterotrophic fungal strain leached manganese with an efficiency of 98%; however, no tantalum was detected in the leachate. An unidentified species did mobilise 16% tantalum in 28 days in an experiment with non-sterile tantalum capacitor scrap. Attempts to cultivate isolate and identify these species failed. The results of a range of leaching trials resulted in an effective strategy for Ta recovery. A bulk sample of homogenised Ta capacitor scrap was first subjected to microbial leaching using Penicillium simplicissimum, which solubilised manganese and base metals. The residue was subjected to the second leach using 4 M HNO3. This effectively solubilised silver and other impurities. The residue collected after the second leach was pure tantalum in concentrated form. The hybrid model produced derives from observations from previous independent studies and shows that we can effectively recover tantalum along with silver and manganese in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner from tantalum capacitor scrap.","[Sikander, Asma; Sievers, Anika; Willner, Thomas] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Dept Proc Engn, Ulmenliet 20, D-20133 Hamburg, Germany; [Sikander, Asma; Hursthouse, Andrew S.] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland; [Sikander, Asma] TUHH Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Wastewater Management & Water Protect, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany; [Kelly, Steven] Univ West Scotland, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Blantyre G72 0LH, Malawi; [Kuchta, Kerstin] TUHH Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Environm Engn & Energy Econ, D-21079 Hamburg, Germany",Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; University of West Scotland; Hamburg University of Technology; Hamburg University of Technology,"Hursthouse, AS (通讯作者)，Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, Paisley PA1 2BE, Renfrew, Scotland.",Asma.sikander@haw-hamburg.de; Steven.kelly@uws.ac.uk; kuchta@tuhh.de; anika.sievers@haw-hamburg.de; thomas.willner@haw-hamburg.de; Andrew.hursthouse@uws.ac.uk,"Kelly, Steven/F-7237-2011; Hursthouse, Andrew/A-9005-2010","Hursthouse, Andrew/0000-0003-3690-2957",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"This study was part sponsored by the EU LIFE-funded project Critical Raw Material Closed Loop Recovery coordinated by WRAP with EARN, ERP UK Ltd, KTN Ltd and Wuppertal Institute as beneficiaries.

This work aims at CO2 conversion to CO with high efficiency at silver (Ag) electrodes with low catalyst loadings. The free-standing electrodes were simply prepared via sputtering deposition, achieving an easy control of the Ag loading. In CO2 electrolysis, a relatively low Ag loading of 151.3 mu g cm(-2) approaches 100% CO selectivity in both KHCO3 and KOH electrolytes. In a KHCO3 electrolyte, this electrode achieves current densities as high as 26.6 and 56.5 mA cm(-2) at -1.0 and -1.2 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, corresponding to mass activities of 175.8 and 373.4 A g(Ag)(-1). Moreover, it also demonstrates high stability during a 15 h test at -1.2 V vs RHE, showing high retention in both the CO selectivity and geometric current density. By optimizing the operation conditions, a single-pass CO2 to CO conversion of about 22% is achieved, and such a high value is maintained for 14 h. When changing to the KOH electrolyte, the electrode shows an impressive increase in current density, achieving 240.0 and 365.0 mA cm(-2) at -1.0 and -1.2 V vs RHE, respectively, corresponding to a high mass activity of 1586.3 and 2412.5 A g(Ag)(-1).

The warmer and drier OTC climate enhanced growth in general, though there were differences among the species and clones, e.g. in bud burst and biomass production. Inter- and intra-specific responses to O-3 and changing climate relate to traits such as allocation patterns between the above- and belowground parts (i.e. root/shoot ratio), which further relate to nutrient and water economy.

Due to the massive generation of photovoltaic waste (expected 34,600 T by 2030), stringent recycling effort to recover metal resources from end-of-life PVs is required for resource recovery, circular economy, and subsequent reduction in the environmental impact. The present study investigates the recycling potential of end-of-life silicon solar modules. The feed characterization reveals that most of the values in PV modules are concentrated in the frame (pure Al), Si wafer (72-84% Si, 9-12% Al, and 0.13-0.71% Ag), and electrical connections (Cu wire coated with Sn). The Si and Ag values in the feed were beneficiated using water fluidization, and concentrate with 90% Si and 2% Ag was attained in the underflow concentrate. Ag values were recovered in the form of AgCl by leaching in nitric acid and precipitation. After the purification step, the residue containing 99% Si can be further utilized to fabricate Si wafer and Al-Si alloy. The preliminary cost estimations suggest that the proposed process is economically viable for the recycling of solar panels with the maximum value generated from the AgCl precipitate followed by Al panels and Si wafers.","[Dhawan, Nikhil; Agrawal, Shrey] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Mat Recycling Lab, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Dhawan, N (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Mat Recycling Lab, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",nikhil.dhawan@mt.iitr.ac.in,"Agrawal, Shrey/HMP-1325-2023","DHAWAN, NIKHIL/0000-0002-0404-4575","Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (Faculty Initiation Grant) [FIG-100714]; Himanshu Tanvar","Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (Faculty Initiation Grant); Himanshu Tanvar","The authors would like to acknowledge the funding received from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (Faculty Initiation Grant; FIG-100714), and Himanshu Tanvar for preliminary experiments.",,25,13,13,15,57,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2524-3462,2524-3470,,MINING METALL EXPLOR,Mining Metall.

Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR) has been employed to scrutinize the impact of said variables at several quantities of green growth. All variables are measured at the same unit using their respective local currency rates. The outcomes revealed that oil, gold, and silver prices influence the green growth of the E-7 economies. However, this negative impact validates the resource curse phenomenon for the sampled countries. Manifestly, fintech improves the conventional mode of the economic cycle in emerging countries and encourages green growth.

The forms and structure of consumption will change, and the needs of older workers will change the production environment, as well as the requirements of distribution. Older people will become not only an engine of consumption in the silver economy but also valuable human resources, which will require them to adapt to the needs of their working environment. Older adults are exposed to risks of events leading to ill health and disability or even death. The rural population is even further away from service centres, which further prevents timely care and preventive care when needed. Smart silver villages using wireless sensors networks embedded in cyber-physical systems using Internet of Things (IoT) as an infrastructure, along with big data and machine learning can support older adults to stay independent longer in their community and mitigate the risk of events leading to ill health and disability. Ambient Assisted Living technologies offer older adults real-time control of activities in their villages and are expected to improve the control of decline in functional capacities of older adults and therefore, improve their quality of life. Ambient intelligence could enable older adults to live safer and thus, longer, in their villages and postpone or even prevent their relocation to a nursing home. Older adults suffer from frailty and decline in physical and cognitive functional capacities and therefore, experience decreased mobility, which can lead to difficulties with activities of daily living. The central gap found in the literature review is a lack of the common dataset for forecasting the needs of older adults and measurement of quality of technologies embedded in smart villages. We need a proper recording of patterns of decline in functional capacities which can cause events leading to ill health and disability. Development of technologies in the last 20 years has created possibilities for developing various models, tools and techniques for supporting older adults to live safer lives and be more well-connected in their communities. Based on these developments, we propose the multi-state competing risk model for control of events leading to ill health and disabilities and show how to forecast the growth of these needs. This approach is especially important for rural areas where the distances and time delays between detection and reaction are too long.

The nanomaterials' (NMs) production, use, and disposal is inevitably leading to their release into the environment where there are uncertainties about its fate, behaviour, and toxicity. Recent works have demonstrated that NMs can penetrate, translocate, and accumulate in plants. However, studies about the effects of the NMs on plants are still limited because most investigations are carried out in the initial stage of plant development. The present study aimed to evaluate and characterize the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of broad bean (Vicia faba) leaves when subjected to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with diameters of 20, 51, and 73 nm as well as to micrometer-size Ag particles (AgBulk). The AgNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The analyses were performed by injecting the leaves with 100 mg L-1 aqueous solution of Ag and measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, gas exchange, thermal imaging, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, silver ion (Ag+) release from Ag particles was determined by dialysis. The results revealed that AgNPs induce a decrease in the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) and an increase in the non-photochemical quenching. The data also revealed that AgNPs affected the stomatal conductance (g(s)) and CO2 assimilation. Further, AgNPs induced an overproduction of ROS in Vicia faba leaves. Finally, all observed effects were particle diameter-dependent, increasing with the reduction of AgNPs diameter and revealing that AgBulk caused only a small or no changes on plants. In summary, the results point out that AgNPs may negatively affect the photosynthesis process when accumulated in the leaves, and that the NPs themselves were mainly responsible since negligible Ag+ release was detected.

Such exploitative social and social-ecological relations are generally understood as contradictory to Indigenous worldviews, which tend to emphasize community well-being and environmental reciprocity over maximizing private accumulation. Enter tourism, tantalizing in its promise as a silver bullet for Indigenous sustainable development. When done right, tourism can generate capitalist economic activity without drastically damaging cultural and ecological systems. This study examines spaces of confluence and divergence in Barrow, Alaska, between current tourism and the values of its Indigenous people, the Inupiat. It considers the scenario of increased tourism in the future and identifies local visions for expanding tourism in a culturally appropriate manner. Key ideas for future development include increasing regulation of cruise ship tourists and enhancing capacity to host high-end tourists. The study reveals conflicting views about using subsistence hunting, fishing and whaling activities as tourism attractions, and concludes that the ability of leaders in Barrow to support Indigenous values through tourism highlights an opportunity and need for a research agenda focused on exploring the relationship between capitalism and its alternatives within tourism destinations.","[Hillmer-Pegram, Kevin] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Resilience & Adaptat Program, Fairbanks, AK USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Hillmer-Pegram, K (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Resilience & Adaptat Program, Fairbanks, AK USA.",khillmerpegram@alaska.edu,,,UAF Center for Global Change Student Research Grant; UAF Center for Global Change; National Science Foundation [1263850],UAF Center for Global Change Student Research Grant; UAF Center for Global Change; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported in part by a UAF Center for Global Change Student Research Grant with funds from the UAF Center for Global Change.

Thus, we examine the response of seven green assets to three energy (jet fuel, crude oil, and natural gas) and two metallic (gold and silver) commodities for the bearish (early COVID-19 period), normal (mid-COVID-19 period), and bullish (higher economic recovery period) market states using the quantiles-on-quantiles technique. The results reveal that green finance serves as a complement to the commodities during the bearish market state, but as the market gradually recovers, the relationship is only sustained for the commonly demanded commodities (i. e. jet fuel, crude oil, and gold) and neutral for others. During the bullish market condition, green finance becomes negatively affected by crude oil, making them substitutes, while it still maintains a complementary and neutral stance with gold and other commodities, respectively.

The production of energy and green adsorbents with unique properties are a few emerging applications of bamboo. Porous structured, bamboo-based charcoal allows the separation of solute from solvent and can be used to detoxify the air, water, and soil. The surface functional groups can be enhanced during thermal processing, yielding activated carbon products and serving greenhouse gas capturing applications.

This has caught the attention of Western policymakers, who want to know why East Asian children obtain such high PISA scores, and what can be done to replicate their success. In this paper I investigate whether children of East Asian descent, who were born and raised in a Western country (Australia), also score highly on the PISA test. I then explore whether their superior performance (relative to children of Australian heritage) can be explained by reasons often given for East Asian students' extraordinary educational achievements. My results suggest that second-generation East Asian immigrants outperform their native Australian peers by approximately 100 test points. Moreover, the magnitude of this achievement gap has increased substantially over the last ten years. Yet there is no 'silver bullet' that can explain why East Asian children obtain such high levels of academic achievement. Rather a combination of factors, each making their own independent contribution, seem to be at play. Consequently, I warn Western policymakers that it may only be possible to catch the leading East Asian economies in the PISA rankings with widespread cultural change.","[Jerrim, John] Univ London, Inst Educ, London WC1H 0AL, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Jerrim, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Inst Educ, Dept Quantitat Social Sci, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.",J.Jerrim@ioe.ac.uk,,"Jerrim, John/0000-0001-5705-7954",Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council Future Research Leaders scheme.,,29,76,92,3,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

For this purpose, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model that captures empirical links between CO2 emissions associated with energy use, the rate and direction of technical change and the economy. We specify CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as the backstop technology whose arrival is anticipated or not. We find a negative value of information in that the discounted welfare loss associated with the emission reduction is lower if CCS is not anticipated. CO2 shadow prices are then relatively high in the years before the CCS has arrived. By not simply waiting with the emission reduction until CCS has arrived, one relies more on economy wide technical change and its welfare enhancing technology externalities in turn allowing for a higher steady state. We believe that policy makers should thus be prudent in designing CO2 emission reduction policy and be careful not to let polluters become complacent by postponing some of their emission reduction efforts awaiting the silver bullet technology on the horizon.

We are already reaping the benefits of improved energy efficiency, material use reduction, and better performance in many existing and new applications that have been enabled by these technological advances. As ENMs pervade the global economy, however, it becomes important to understand their environmental implications. As a first step, we combined ENM market information and material flow modeling to produce the first global assessment of the likely ENM emissions to the environment and landfills. The top ten most produced ENMs by mass were analyzed in a dozen major applications. Emissions during the manufacturing, use, and disposal stages were estimated, including intermediate steps through wastewater treatment plants and waste incineration plants. In 2010, silica, titania, alumina, and iron and zinc oxides dominate the ENM market in terms of mass flow through the global economy, used mostly in coatings/paints/pigments, electronics and optics, cosmetics, energy and environmental applications, and as catalysts. We estimate that 63-91 % of over 260,000-309,000 metric tons of global ENM production in 2010 ended up in landfills, with the balance released into soils (8-28 %), water bodies (0.4-7 %), and atmosphere (0.1-1.5 %). While there are considerable uncertainties in the estimates, the framework for estimating emissions can be easily improved as better data become available. The material flow estimates can be used to quantify emissions at the local level, as inputs for fate and transport models to estimate concentrations in different environmental compartments.","[Keller, Arturo A.; McFerran, Suzanne; Lazareva, Anastasiya; Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Keller, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",keller@bren.ucsb.edu,"Keller, Arturo/AAB-4155-2022; Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011",,National Science Foundation (NSF); US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) [DBI-0830117],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)(United States Environmental Protection Agency),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under Cooperative Agreement Number DBI-0830117.

First, based on the ecological economy theory of lucid waters and lush mountains are golden and silver mountains (the two mountains theory), we integrated the theories and methods of ecology, economics, and geography disciplines to examine the transformation of ecological advantages into economic development from a comprehensive perspective. Second, based on the matching relationship between the division of major function zones and the classification of ecological services, we creatively constructed a theoretical framework for the endogenous development of rural areas. Third, accounting indicators and methods for rural ecological products' biophysical quantity and monetary value are established. Finally, we conducted an empirical study of Nanshi Village in central China as a case. The results showed that: The benefits provided by ecosystems to the development of human society would be underestimated if it is measured only by the provisioning services; the per capita Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) of the case area was three times the per capita disposable income of rural permanent residents in the same period. Taking advantage of the rural ecological environment to promote the actual transformation of the potential value of ecological products is the feasible path for rural revitalization. One of the implications of this study is that it links the rural ecological and environmental advantages with social and economic development from the perspective of ecological economics and provides decision-making support for this case and other similar rural ecological industry revitalization practices.","[Guo, Xinwei; Yu, Bin; Yan, Meiyan; Guo, Hui; Ren, Junhu; Zhang, Hanxia; Zhang, Zonggang] Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinwei; Yu, Bin; Yan, Meiyan; Guo, Hui; Ren, Junhu; Zhang, Hanxia; Zhang, Zonggang] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Yan, Meiyan] Dali Univ, Coll Teacher Educ, Dali 671003, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University; Central China Normal University; Dali University,"Yu, B (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Yu, B (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",yubin@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42271227, 41671179]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2022YBZZ001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42271227, No. 41671179), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2022YBZZ001).",,73,6,7,21,154,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Dissipative flows of metals become inaccessible for future users, going against the common goal of a more circular economy. Therefore, they should be addressed in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) in the area of protection Natural Resources. However, life cycle inventory databases provide limited information on dissipation as they only track emissions to the environment as elementary flows. Therefore, we propose two LCIA methods capturing the expected dissipation patterns of metals after extraction, based on dynamic material flow analysis data. The methods are applied to resource elementary flows in life cycle inventories. The lost potential service time method provides precautionary indications on the lost service due to dissipation over different time horizons. The average dissipation rate method distinguishes between the conservation potentials of different metals. Metals that are relatively well conserved, including major metals such as iron and aluminum, have low characterization factors (CFs). Those with poor process yields, including many companion and high-tech metals such as gallium and tellurium, have high CFs. A comparative study between the developed CFs, along with those of the Abiotic Depletion Potential and Environmental Dissipation Potential methods, show that dissipation trends do not consistently match those of the depletion and environmental dissipation potentials. The proposed methods may thus be complementary to other methods when assessing the impacts of resource use on the area of protection Natural Resources when pursuing an increased material circularity.

Based on ethnographic research conducted in Kampala, Uganda, this article examines the entanglement of material and immaterial labor in the production of briquettes. The outcome of these production processes is to capitalize Community, transforming everyday socio-spatial relations into an agential entrepreneurial subject fit to receive aid and carry out development. This has the additional effect of exacerbating differences of gender and education within the CBO, alienating the CBO from the rest of Bwaise, and reproducing the racial hierarchies of the development economy.","[Doherty, Jacob] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Urban Mobil, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Doherty, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Urban Mobil, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford, England.",,"Doherty, Jacob/O-8897-2019","Doherty, Jacob/0000-0001-9979-9745",,,,,49,6,7,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0147-5479,1471-6445,,INT LABOR WORK-CLASS,Int.

Yet this productivity came at a terrible cost for Andean people forced to work in the mines, and colonial critics forcefully debated the morality and legality of the mining economy even as it became essential to the colonial project itself. More than any others, the mercury mines of Huancavelica, Peru became synonymous with this conflict between the human toll of colonial exploitation and immense mineral wealth of the Andes. As the only Andean source of the mercury required to refine silver and a mine infamous for its toxic conditions, Huancavelica became a crucial source of debate over the conditions in which the Spanish Empire could and should employ forced labor. Royal officials attempted to soothe pious critics, maintain mercury production, and preserve the Andean labor force while Spanish miners and Andean communities vied for their own interests. This article examines conflicts over nocturnal labor to shed light on these dynamics, challenging simplistic understandings of labor relations at the mines where Andeans actively advocated for themselves, miners challenged royal policy, and even seemingly favorable conditions failed to yield tangible reforms.","[Dries, Mark Pierre] Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Hist & Polit Sci, Hammond, LA 70402 USA",University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University,"Dries, MP (通讯作者)，Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Hist & Polit Sci, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",mark.dries@selu.edu,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0147-5479,1471-6445,,INT LABOR WORK-CLASS,Int.

While transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective diarylation of tethered alkenes has been employed to prepare important chiral cyclic compounds, the direct use of simple arenes as aryl precursors is still underdeveloped, probably due to the difficulties in the effective control of the reactivity, site-selectivity and/or enantioselectivity. Herein we report an asymmetric Pd/Ag dual metal catalytic system for the non-directed, site- and enantioselective domino Heck/intermolecular C-H functionalization of arenes. Mechanistic studies showed that Pd and Ag act in cooperation in the catalysis and the chiral bisphosphine ligand plays a bifunctional role, i.e., assisting the silver species in the cleavage of the aryl C-H bond, while inducing the enantioselectivity on direct complexation with palladium. This method provides an efficient approach to the corresponding chiral oxindoles with good enantiomeric excesses from a broad scope of arenes, including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes and several complex products derived from medicines or natural products.","[Yao, Jian; Huo, Xiaohong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Engn & Chiral Drugs, Frontiers Sci Ctr Transformat Mol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jian; Zhao, Can; Shao, Lili; Wang, Xiaoming] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Excellence Mol Synth, State Key Lab Organomet Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jian; Zhao, Can; Shao, Lili; Wang, Xiaoming] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Excellence Mol Synth, Shanghai Hongkong Joint Lab Chem Synth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Hangzhou Inst Adv Study, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Hangzhou 310024, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, XM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Excellence Mol Synth, State Key Lab Organomet Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;Wang, XM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Excellence Mol Synth, Shanghai Hongkong Joint Lab Chem Synth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;Wang, XM (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Hangzhou Inst Adv Study, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Hangzhou 310024, Peoples R China.",xiaoming@sioc.ac.cn,"huo, xiaohong/H-7622-2013; Wang, Xiaoming/GLT-3923-2022",,"National Key R&D Program of China [2021YFA1500100]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB0610000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [92256303, 22171278, 21821002]; Shanghai Science and Technology Committee [23ZR1482400]; Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo [2023J034]",National Key R&D Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Science and Technology Committee(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFA1500100), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB0610000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (92256303, 22171278, 21821002), the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (23ZR1482400) and the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (2023J034).",,73,1,1,10,18,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7291,1869-1870,,SCI CHINA CHEM,Sci.

The proposed emulsion-based conducting ink formulation takes into consideration circular economy and green principles throughout the entire process, from the selection of materials to the production process. The ink is formulated using the biopolymer polylactic acid dissolved in a sustainable solvent mixed with water, along with conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and silver flakes as fillers. Hybrid conductive fillers can lower the percolation threshold of the ink and the production costs, while maintaining excellent electrical properties. The coating formed after the deposition of the ink, undergoes isothermal treatment at different temperatures and durations to improve its adhesion and electrical properties. The coating's performance was evaluated by creating an eight-finger interdigitated sensor using a Voltera PCB printer. The sensor demonstrates exceptional performance when exposed to various loading and unloading pressures within the 0.2-500.0 kPa range. The results show a consistent correlation between the change in electrical resistance and the stress caused by the applied load. The ink is biodegradable in marine environments, which helps avoiding its accumulation in the ecosystem over time.","[Najafi, Maedeh; Forestier, Emilie; Safarpour, Milad; Zych, Arkadiusz; Bertolacci, Laura; Athanassiou, Athanassia; Bayer, Ilker] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Smart Mat, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Forestier, Emilie] Ist Italiano Tecnol, iCub Tech, Via S Quir 19d, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Ceseracciu, Luca] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Mat Characterizat Facil, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy; [Bagheri, Ahmad] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Graphene Labs, Via Morego 30, Genoa, Italy",Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT,"Najafi, M; Athanassiou, A; Bayer, I (通讯作者)，Ist Italiano Tecnol, Smart Mat, Via Morego 30, I-16163 Genoa, Italy.",Maedeh.najafi@iit.it; Athanassia.Athanassiou@iit.it; Ilker.Bayer@iit.it,"Ceseracciu, Luca/E-9675-2011; Athanassiou, Athanassia/B-4197-2018","Najafi, Maedeh/0000-0001-5996-2018; Athanassiou, Athanassia/0000-0002-6533-3231",,,,,108,3,3,3,10,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAY 14,2024,14,1,,,,,,,10988,10.1038/s41598-024-60315-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-60315-z,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,QT4O9,38744852,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001223110500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Compared with conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis should be a better pretreatment process, because it can provide higher aluminum recovery rate and would not alter the surface structure and composition of c-Si solar modules as conventional pyrolysis did. The recovery products, including aluminum, silver and silicon crystal, were obtained with the recovery rates of 94.90 %, 95.74 % and 83 %, and the purities of 99.63 %, 100 % and 99.98 %, respectively. Cylindrical diffusion and pseudo-second-order models best fit the experimental data of sulfuric acid and nitric acid leaching, respectively, implying that the mechanisms of aluminum and silver dissolution would be different. The return on investment of spent c-Si solar modules recycling by using the methods involved in this study would be approximately 113 %. Therefore, total resource recovery from spent c-Si solar modules can be nearly achieved by using these methods, showing great potential for commercial applications and high possibility of establishing circular economy. The operational parameters and reaction kinetics found in this study can be applied to other kinds of solar modules or electronic waste for resource recovery and environmental protection.","[Huang, Yu-Fong; Cheng, Ting-Ting; Chiueh, Pei-Te; Lo, Shang-Lien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 1 Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chiueh, Pei-Te; Lo, Shang-Lien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Water Innovat Low Carbon & Environm Sustainabil Re, 1 Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lo, Shang-Lien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Sci & Technol Res Inst De Carbonizat STRIDE C, 1 Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Lo, SL (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Environm Engn, 1 Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",sllo@ntu.edu.tw,"CHENG, TING/GPX-2372-2022",,"National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Parallelly, new recycling technology developments are required to address the incoming volume of waste as they gradually approach their end-of-life (EoL) to realize the concept of a circular economy. Typical recycling processes involve high-temperature burning for separation and release of the PV cells for metal recovery processes. However, this thermal process generates gaseous by-products that cause serious health and environmental issues. Eschewing the need for burning, we demonstrate a simple crush-and-sieve methodology to strategically aids the separation of polymeric and metallic contents. The proposed approach showcased the efficient size-selective separation and generated polymer- and metal-rich fractions. More than 90 % of the total polymer present within the studied wastes was found to be retained in larger sized-particle fractions (F1 and F2). Metal content analysis highlighted the enrichment of highly valuable silver into the smallest sized-particle fraction (F4), accounting up to 70 % and 80 % of total silver present respectively for EVAc and MP. The benefits ripe through this simple crush-and-sieve method offers an attractive pathway for PV recycling process to obtain metal-rich fractions and allow focused recovery of valuable materials through an environmentally friendlier manner.","[Sim, Ying; Tay, Yeow Boon; Pham, Huu Khue; Mathews, Nripan] Nanyang Technol Univ ERI N, Energy Res Inst, 1 Cleantech Loop, Singapore 637141, Singapore; [Sim, Ying; Pham, Huu Khue; Mathews, Nripan] Singapore CEA Alliance Res Circular Econ SCARCE, 62 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637459, Singapore; [Tay, Yeow Boon] Nanyang Technol Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch IGS, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Mathews, Nripan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University,"Mathews, N (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",Nripan@ntu.edu.sg,"Mathews, Nripan/HNC-3573-2023","Sim, Ying/0000-0003-0017-2630","National Research Foundation, Singapore; National Environment Agency, Singapore [USS-IF-2018-4]","National Research Foundation, Singapore(National Research Foundation, Singapore); National Environment Agency, Singapore","This research/project is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, and National Environment Agency, Singapore under its Closing the Waste Loop Funding Initiative (Award No. USS-IF-2018-4).

Oil price proxies for fundamentals, while gold and silver prices capture sentiments. We find that the metrics for fundamentals and sentiments both predict real stock returns of South Africa, with nonlinearity, modeled by decomposing these prices into their respective positive and negative counterparts, playing an important role in terms of forecasting when a longer out-of-sample period spanning over three-quarters of a century is used. When compared to fundamentals, sentiments, particularly real gold prices, have a relatively stronger role to play in forecasting real stock returns.

It is therefore important to quantify and estimate both current stocks and flows of such materials, as well as future requirement for industries and economies. In this study, which is focused on wind energy system in the European Union (EU) 27, the current consumption and future requirement of critical and precious materials were calculated and estimated using the wind power production dataset from ecoinvent and data from National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP). It is shown that fluorspar has been the most consumed material to date, and will probably be the most required material in the future. Among other critical and valuable materials, the main materials used for current wind energy system are silver, magnesium, indium, gold and tantalum. These materials will also be required significantly by 2020 for the wind energy system in the EU 27. It is argued that these results should be connected to the future energy and material policy and management. (C) 20114 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous environmental impact and safety studies that targeted nanomaterials typically focused on their toxicity, fate and behavior; little attention was paid on biodiversity consequences. Evidence for acute biodiversity change derived from nanomaterials is very limited.

The circulation of social values negotiated through gossip enabled a century-long period during which brothels flourished in an illegal yet decriminalized way. Even though the madams and sex workers were subject to spatial restrictions and the whims of local political and regulatory power, they managed to harness the available means of opportunistic discourse often overlooked in rhetorical analysis. I highlight the influence of the semi-private exchange of rumor and normative small talk. Arising out of spatial and qualitative public memory, gossip can be a persuasive force that harmonizes community needs across past, present, and future.","[Branstetter, Heather Lee] Hist Wallace Preservat Soc, POB 709, Wallace, ID 83873 USA",,"Branstetter, HL (通讯作者)，Hist Wallace Preservat Soc, POB 709, Wallace, ID 83873 USA.",heatherleebranstetter@gmail.com,,,Wallace District Mining Museum; Virginia Military Institute,Wallace District Mining Museum; Virginia Military Institute,"Funding, material support, and guidance for this project was provided by the Wallace District Mining Museum.

Physical, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods for valuable metals recovery from copper slag are particularly reviewed in this paper. Besides, this paper then introduces a novel technique proposed by Northeastern University of China which can achieve high-value and slag-free treatment of molten copper slag. It is much preferred over the current methods. This method significantly increases the added value of the product and greatly reduces energy consumption. This paper reviews the comprehensive utilization of copper slag and provides some recommendations for the large-scale and green utilization of copper slag in the future.","[Hao, Jun; Dou, Zhi'he; Zhang, Ting'an; Wang, Kun] Northeastern Univ, Special Met & Proc Engn Inst, Key Lab Ecol Met Multimet Intergrown Ores, Minist Educ, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Ministry of Education - China; Northeastern University - China,"Dou, ZH (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Special Met & Proc Engn Inst, Key Lab Ecol Met Multimet Intergrown Ores, Minist Educ, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",douzh@smm.neu.edu.cn,"李, 建/HNJ-6710-2023; Hao, Jun/HHC-2483-2022","Hao, Jun/0000-0001-7100-1834; Dou, Zhihe/0000-0002-5020-6192","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1702253, 51774078, U1908225]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [N182515007, N2025004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1702253, 51774078 and U1908225) and the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (N182515007 and N2025004).",,25,4,4,6,80,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-1181,2367-1696,978-3-030-92563-5; 978-3-030-92562-8,MINERAL MET MAT SER,,,2022,,,,,,,355,365,,10.1007/978-3-030-92563-5_36,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-92563-5_36,,,11,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,BS8JJ,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000772632500036,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a concept for the directly coupled production of CO2-based methanol and formaldehyde in a modified silver catalyst process is evaluated regarding the utilization of H-2. Detailed simulations in Aspen Plus allow the comparison to the separately operated synthesis of green methanol and formaldehyde.

They become more and more interconnected and interdependent with the development of scientific technology and social economy. Risk and vulnerability analysis of interdependent infrastructures for security considerations has become an important subject, and some achievements have been made in this area. Since different infrastructure systems have different structural and functional properties, there is no universal all-encompassing 'silver bullet solution' to the problem of analyzing the vulnerability associated with interdependent infrastructure systems. So a framework of analysis is required. This paper takes the power and water systems of a major city in China as an example and develops a framework for the analysis of the vulnerability of interdependent infrastructure systems. Four interface design strategies based on distance, betweenness, degree, and clustering coefficient are constructed. Then two types of vulnerability (long-term vulnerability and focused vulnerability) are illustrated and analyzed. Finally, a method for ranking critical components in interdependent infrastructures is given for protection purposes. It is concluded that the framework proposed here is useful for vulnerability analysis of interdependent systems and it will be helpful for the system owners to make better decisions on infrastructure design and protection.

This study examines macroeconomic instability by assessing the commodities market in highly traded regimes using descriptive statistical analysis, the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index, and Markov Regime Swapping (MRS) for data covering February 26 to November 30, 2020. The findings indicate that most commodities respond to stock values in both high and low-volatility regimes of supply and demand. Additionally, commodity prices are still in a low volatility regime due to COVID-19-related market uncertainty. The returns for oil, corn, gold, copper, natural gas, silver, and soybeans adapt to low macroeconomic uncertainty and variable rankings for COVID-19. In contrast, changes in COVID-19 deaths had no impact on natural gas or oil under any regime. As agricultural commodities and valuable metals have less negative feedback to exogenous variables than any other commodities, this model is useful for regulators and stockholders. The results suggest that in a global pandemic, portfolio managers and other stakeholders should use priceless metals like gold as a short-term hedge against systemic market risks to achieve macroeconomic stability and facilitate a rapid recovery in the green economy.","[Wang, Xiangyu] Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yi] Chengdu Univ Technol, Humanities & Law Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Minmin] Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoyun] Chengdu Sport Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Sichuan Normal University; Chengdu University of Technology; Sichuan Normal University; Chengdu Sport University,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Chengdu Univ Technol, Humanities & Law Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yangyi314721@sina.com,,,,,,,56,10,11,4,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This result can be explained by the qualitative nature of these surveys and their ability to provide information in advance of major official macroeconomic indicators. Nevertheless, we show that survey news announcements can also be useful in resolving commodity market uncertainty in periods of heightened global financial turmoil and when the manufacturing sector of the largest economies is in contraction.","[Fernandez-Perez, Adrian] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Lopez, Raquel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ & Finance, Albacete, Spain; [Fernandez-Perez, Adrian] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Auckland University of Technology,"Fernandez-Perez, A (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Finance, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",adrian.fernandez@aut.ac.nz,"Lopez, Raquel/E-5618-2017","Lopez, Raquel/0000-0001-7331-4455; Fernandez-Perez, Adrian/0000-0002-9433-7194","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana [ECO 2017-89715-P]; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha [2020-GRIN-28832, 2021-GRIN-31019]","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana(Spanish Government); Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Grant/Award Numbers: 2020-GRIN -28832, 2021-GRIN-31019; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana, Grant/Award Number: ECO 2017-89715-P",,92,1,1,5,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0270-7314,1096-9934,,J FUTURES MARKETS,J.

Two main estimation methods are proposed. The first (the direct method) is used to measure the value of government-provided, legal-tender coin supply only. Two varieties of the direct method are proposed. Additionally, an indirect method is proposed which relies on a combination of information about nominal GDP with an assumption regarding the evolution of velocity in time, and which can be used to calculate coin supply and M2. Both methods rely on benchmark values known for certain years, but no particular benchmark is determinant for the results. The new methodologies set out here may serve as a blueprint for a similar reconstruction of coin and money supply series for other economies for which analogous data are available.","[Palma, Nuno] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Palma, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.",,"Palma, Nuno/KBC-2768-2024","Palma, Nuno/0000-0003-4614-6518",,,,,49,26,29,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Utilizing data from the China Family Panel Studies and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index, the research employs empirical testing methods, including OLS regression and instrumental variable estimation, to analyze the relationship between DFI and consumption expenditures among the elderly. The findings reveal that DFI enhances the elderly's access to finance by breaking down barriers, improving financial acumen, personalizing fintech solutions, and stimulating their consumption capacity. It also shows that poorer health increases consumption, while marriage and family size reduce spending. Household income significantly predicts consumption levels, with wealthier elderly consuming more. DFI optimizes consumption patterns, boosting living standards and enjoyment activities and elevating the elderly's quality of life. This study uses the latest data from China to reveal the impact of DFI on the consumption expenditure and consumption structure of elderly people, offering insights for policymakers to develop targeted strategies that leverage digital finance for improving elderly living standards and stimulating the silver economy.

The development of a large global energy storage capacity and the production of green hydrogen or other synthetic fuels by renewable energy will be critical. The estimated needed global PV generating capacity will be about 70 TW by 2050. The PV industry needs to rapidly grow its production capacity to about 3 TW p.a. to reach this objective. The industry has demonstrated that it is capable to grow at a very high rate and to continuously reduce the cost of manufacturing. There are no challenges related to the technology, manufacturing cost, or sustainability, except for the consumption of silver, which needs to be reduced by at least a factor of 4, and the recycling of material used in the PV system, which needs to be dramatically improved. The deployment of PV systems must be accelerated to reach a fast growth (>25%) until at least 2032 to avoid a major market downturn in 2050.","[Verlinden, P.

This study aimed to maximize carbon utilization from HORW into syngas and carbon-based biosolid through thermochemical conversion, contributing to a circular economy. To improve syngas production, CO2 was introduced during the pyrolysis. In conventional pyrolysis, additional CO production was observed, attributed to a homogenous reaction between CO2 and VOCs derived from HORW. To further promote this reaction, an in-line pyrolysis setup was applied, which facilitated thermal cracking of VOCs and led to a 1.7-fold increase in syngas yield compared to the conventional pyrolysis, but did not significantly enhance CO2 reactivity. In contrast, the presence of Ni-based catalyst effectively activated the CO2-induced homogenous reaction, resulting in a 3.4-fold higher syngas yield than conventional pyrolysis. Moreover, CO2-assisted pyrolysis modified the physicochemical properties of the biosolid, yielded a biosolid with enhanced specific surface area and cation exchange capacity compared to the inert condition. These enhancements contributed to superior soil amendment potential. Overall, the use of CO2 in the thermochemical conversion of HORW could be a promising pathway for valorizing waste, aligned with circular economic principles.","[Kwon, Dohee; Kim, Jee Young; Kwon, Eilhann E.] Hanyang Univ, Dept Earth Resources & Environm Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kwon, EE (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Earth Resources & Environm Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",ek2148@hanyang.ac.kr,"Kwon, Eilhann/AGY-3339-2022",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT) [RS-2023-00219667]; Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (No. RS-2023-00219667) .

In this study, the long-term relationship between the precious metal prices and the Islamic stock markets of countries grouped by the Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) according to their level of development was examined. In the economies included in the study, it is necessary that the Islamic stock index be created by MSCI. It is not a constraint as a Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach - This study used the Pedroni panel cointegration analysis and full modified ordinary least square method. All analyses in this study were performed using monthly data from 2002 to 2015. Findings - According to the Pedroni panel cointegration analysis applied in this study, all four precious metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium - are effective portfolio diversification tools for developed Islamic stock markets within the analyzed period. However, in developing countries, although gold and palladiumare effective portfolio diversification tools, silver and platinumare not. Practical implications - These results provide practical implications for academicians, practitioners as portfolio managers, policymakers. These implications are related in portfolio risk management, the diversification benefits and to propose new investment tools among developed and developing Islamic markets. Social implications - This study is important for investors who assemble portfolios under the restriction of selecting investment tools suitable for Islamic rules. These investors are important in terms of using precious metals that they prefer as an alternative to stock markets to protect against the risks related to their suitable portfolio options. Governments, individuals and institutional investors that use capital stock according to Islamic rules in developed countries can effectively use gold, silver, platinum and palladium as hedging tools. However, this choice is limited to only gold and palladium in developing country markets. Gold continues to be an effective diversification tool in Islamic share markets, as in traditional stock markets. Originality/value - The author would like to emphasize that this article is second to examine precious metals and Islamic stock markets in literature.","[Tuna, Gulfen] Sakarya Univ, Sakarya Business Sch, Sakarya, Turkey",Sakarya University,"Tuna, G (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Sakarya Business Sch, Sakarya, Turkey.",geksi@sakarya.edu.tr,"Tuna, Gulfen/ADX-6850-2022",,,,,,48,31,31,3,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-8394,1753-8408,,INT J ISLAMIC MIDDLE,Int.J.

Only 40% of the crop is utilised, leading to 114 million tonnes of banana waste annually. Banana peel constitutes about similar to 40% of the whole fruit, and it is considered a domestic and food industry waste. It is enriched with macronutrients, micronutrients and bioactive compounds, which can provide antioxidant, anti-microbial, antibiotic, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical properties. Banana peels also have higher nutrient value than banana pulp, and they are used in traditional medicines to treat diabetes, diarrhoea, inflammation, ulcers, burns and cough. Given its diverse bioactive properties, banana peel waste is now being explored within the framework of a circular economy to promote waste recycling and reduce environmental impact. This review highlights the nutritional and health properties of banana peel while providing opportunities for waste reduction. Potential applications of banana peels include anti-cancer and anti-fungal agents, biosorbents, natural emulsifiers, reducing agents, biofertilisers, food industry ingredients for bakery products, natural preservatives and food fortification. Exploring banana peel waste potential not only contributes to sustainable waste management but also enhances environmentally friendly innovation for the benefit of human health and the environment.","[Yasin, Mursleen; Gangan, Shreya; Panchal, Sunil K.] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci, Hawkesbury Campus, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Panchal, SK (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci, Hawkesbury Campus, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia.",20485678@student.westernsydney.edu.au; sagangan21@gmail.com; s.panchal@westernsydney.edu.au,,,,,,,151,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

For example, several plant-based materials are nowadays used in packaging and biofuel production. Among them, by-products and waste from coffee processing constitute a largely available, low cost, good quality resource. Coffee production includes many steps, in which by-products are generated including coffee pulp, coffee husks, silver skin and spent coffee. This review aims to analyze the reasons why coffee waste can be considered as a valuable source in recycling strategies for the sustainable production of bio-based chemicals, materials and fuels. It addresses the most recent advances in monomer, polymer and plastic filler productions and applications based on the development of viable biorefinery technologies. The exploration of strategies to unlock the potential of this biomass for fuel productions is also revised. Coffee by-products valorization is a clear example of waste biorefinery. Future applications in areas such as biomedicine, food packaging and material technology should be taken into consideration. However, further efforts in techno-economic analysis and the assessment of the feasibility of valorization processes on an industrial scale are needed.","[Sisti, Laura; Celli, Annamaria; Totaro, Grazia] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Chim Ambientale & Mat, Via Terracini 28, I-40131 Bologna, Italy; [Cinelli, Patrizia; Signori, Francesca; Lazzeri, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Civile & Ind, Largo Lucio Lazzarino 1, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bikaki, Maria; Corvini, Philippe] FHNW, Inst Ecopreneurship, Sch Life Sci, Hofackerstr 30, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland; [Ferri, Maura; Tassoni, Annalisa] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Biol Geol & Ambientali, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Navarini, Luciano] Illy Caffe SpA, Via Flavia 110, I-34147 Trieste, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Pisa; FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland; University of Bologna,"Celli, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Chim Ambientale & Mat, Via Terracini 28, I-40131 Bologna, Italy.",laura.sisti@unibo.it; annamaria.celli@unibo.it; grazia.totaro@unibo.it; patrizia.cinelli@unipi.it; francesca.signori@unipi.it; andrea.lazzeri@unipi.it; maria.bikaki@fhnw.ch; philippe.corvini@fhnw.ch; maura.ferri@unibo.it; annalisa.tassoni2@unibo.it; luciano.navarini@illy.it,"corvini, philippe/H-9074-2013; Totaro, Grazia/AAO-6157-2021; Signori, Francesca/Y-6178-2019; Lazzeri, Andrea/AAI-8523-2021; Cinelli, Patrizia/AAN-5963-2020; Signori, Francesca/G-1937-2010; Celli, Annamaria/K-7631-2013; Lazzeri, Andrea/I-9463-2014; TASSONI, ANNALISA/G-3981-2012","Signori, Francesca/0000-0002-9211-5352; Totaro, Grazia/0000-0002-7388-8894; Celli, Annamaria/0000-0002-5974-1642; Lazzeri, Andrea/0000-0002-9463-1502; FERRI, MAURA/0000-0001-5428-4369; Corvini, Philippe/0000-0002-2991-5031; Sisti, Laura/0000-0003-4445-3880; Navarini, Luciano/0000-0002-9539-7500; TASSONI, ANNALISA/0000-0002-3541-4030","PROLIFIC project (Integrated cascades of processes for the extraction and valorization of protein and bioactive molecules from legumes, fungi and coffee agro-industrial side streams) from the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the European Unio [790157]","PROLIFIC project (Integrated cascades of processes for the extraction and valorization of protein and bioactive molecules from legumes, fungi and coffee agro-industrial side streams) from the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the European Unio","This work was supported by the PROLIFIC project (Integrated cascades of processes for the extraction and valorization of protein and bioactive molecules from legumes, fungi and coffee agro-industrial side streams), which receives funding from the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, under grant agreement No 790157.",,99,24,25,10,101,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,12,,,,,,,6921,10.3390/su13126921,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126921,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SZ7VT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000666768600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For that reason, the scientific society is focused on biopolymers such as chitosan, which is the second most abundant in the world after cellulose. These new materials should show good properties in terms of sustainability, circularity, and energy consumption during industrial applications. The idea is to replace traditional raw materials with new ecofriendly materials which contribute to keeping a high production rate but also reducing its environmental impact and the costs. The chitosan shows interesting and unique properties, thus it can be used for different purposes which contributes to the design and development of sustainable novel materials. This helps in promoting sustainability through the use of chitosan and diverse materials based on it. For example, it is a good sustainable alternative for food packaging or it can be used for sustainable agriculture. The chitosan can also reduce the pollution of other industrial processes such as paper production.

For this purpose, the newly developed panel data estimation method Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression (DSUR) is applied. According to the results, the impact of ICTs on economic growth remains positive in South Asian economies. In addition, education stimulates economic growth; however, foreign direct investment does not contribute to economic growth. The newly acquired result would guide policymakers and government officials to focus on the advancement of ICT for maintaining the sustainable economic growth. The findings imply that South Asian countries should raise the ICT level with proper technology education level to achieve the desired economic growth.","[Liu Ximei] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Latif, Zahid] Gomal Univ, Inst Business Adm, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan; [Danish] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Trade & Econ, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Latif, Shahid] Sarhad Univ Sci & Informat Technol, Ring Rd Campus, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [ul Waraa, Kaif] Islamia Univ Peshawar Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Gomal University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Danish (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Trade & Econ, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",khan.danishkhan@hotmail.com,"-, Danish/AEV-8555-2022; Latif, Zahid/B-3693-2015; latif, zahid/V-4307-2018",", Danish/0000-0003-1046-1655; latif, zahid/0000-0001-6735-7555",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ21G010007],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, (grant number LQ21G010007).",,45,5,5,2,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0266-6669,1741-6469,,INFORM DEV,Inf.

All economies under examination in this study are well described by Markov switching intercept heteroscedasticity-vector error correction models. We detect both estimated intercepts and variances differ across regimes. According to results, the effect of precious metal production on economic growth is various. As a whole, there is a long-run relationship between each precious metal production and economic growth. In the short run, whereas gold production has a negative effect on USA's and Canada's economies, which supports resource curse, it has positive one on South Africa's. The effect of silver production on economic growth of Australia and Peru is negative, but it is positive for Canada and South Africa. While copper production has a positive effect on the economic growth of Australia and South Africa, we find supporting evidence for resource curse for Canada, Peru and USA. We also find insignificant correlation between any precious metals and economic growth for Mexico and Philippines.","[Bildirici, Melike E.] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Davutpasa, Turkey; [Gokmenoglu, Seyit M.] Yildiz Tech Univ, Inst Social Sci, Davutpasa, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University; Yildiz Technical University,"Bildirici, ME (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Davutpasa, Turkey.",melikebildirici@gmail.com,"Bildirici, Melike/P-5576-2015","Bildirici, Melike/0000-0003-3925-844X",,,,,56,17,17,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1520-7439,1573-8981,,NAT RESOUR RES,Nat.

However, they remain relatively rare compared with dominant investor-owned platforms. Traditionally, worker cooperatives strive for alternative organizing based on the ideal of workplace democracy but are often faced with unequal participation by members in decision-making processes. To test for participation inequalities, this study used survey data (n = 418) from a network of four platform worker cooperatives in Italy. The results show that members with lower affective commitment towards their cooperative and less social capital among other members are less likely to participate, but that there is no effect of cooperative size and human capital.","[Bunders, Damion J.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Business Soc Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bunders, Damion J.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Business Soc Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bunders, DJ (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Dept Business Soc Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bunders@rsm.nl,,"Bunders, Damion Jonathan/0000-0002-7007-3577","The author thanks three anonymous reviewers and Alya Guseva, in her role as editor, for their helpful feedback and encouragement.

Although silver-based materials have already been successfully developed in dealing with the infections of drug-resistant bacteria, there has been much controversy over the applications of them because the waste silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are potentially harmful to humanity and the environment. To address this issue, gliadin@AgNPs hybrid nanoparticles with ultralow minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were designed via growing AgNPs on amphiphilic gliadin molecule, followed by co-assembly-induced nanoencapsulation of AgNPs. The highly monodispersed gliadin nanoparticles (similar to 120 nm) infused with ultrasmall AgNPs (2-3 nm) were synthesized successfully. This strategy protected AgNPs from aggregation and fast oxidation, exerted programmed release profiles. In vitro antibacterial experiments demonstrate the hybrids could kill a broad-spectrum bacteria at an ultralow Ag equivalent, with MBCs of 0.0312 and 0.125 mu g/mL for E. coli and MRSA, respectively. More importantly, its MBC against E. coli below the safety threshold established by the WHO for drinking water (0.1 ppm). Using the hybrid nanostructure as building blocks, we fabricated unprecedented protein-based antimicrobial porous materials for the first time through Pickering HIPEs templates, which was characterized by the formation of gliadin@AgNPs-decorated nanostructures on the pore wall of porous materials. They have a complex interlaced tubular porous structure with over 96 % porosity, presenting programmed release behavior of Ag+, and were able to inhibit the growth of tested bacteria at concentrations that did not affect the viability of HaCaT human cells, confirming that hierarchical nanomaterials possess valid antibacterial activity within the cellular viability concentration range. Particularly, the antimicrobial protein porous material promoted HaCaT cell adhesion and proliferation within its hierarchical nanostructure. This work provides new insights into the rational design of advanced gliadin@AgNPs as a potent antibacterial nanoplatform with a much smaller environmental impact and health concerns and a building block for constructing protein-based porous materials with outstanding antimicrobial performance and biocompatibility for emerging applications in catalysis, tissue engineering, and environmental engineering.","[Huang, Xiaonan; Liu, Bo; Ma, Juanjuan; Wei, Shuheng; Wang, Like; Yin, Shouwei; Yang, Xiaoquan] South China Univ Technol, Res & Dev Ctr Food Prot, Sch Food Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Green Proc Nat Prod & Prod, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shouwei] China Singapore Int Joint Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Yin, SW (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Res & Dev Ctr Food Prot, Sch Food Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Green Proc Nat Prod & Prod, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",feysw@scut.edu.cn,"like, Wang/GZM-3528-2022; Ma, Juan/KPB-2288-2024; Yin, Shou-Wei/ABD-5176-2021; Yang, Xiao-quan/ISV-4446-2023; Huang, Xiaonan/AAP-6905-2020",,R&D Projects in Key Areas of Guangzhou [202206010194]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2023ZYGXZR016]; Guangdong special support program [2019BT02N112]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2021A1515010732],R&D Projects in Key Areas of Guangzhou; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Guangdong special support program; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"This work was supported by the project granted by R & D Projects in Key Areas of Guangzhou (202206010194), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2023ZYGXZR016), Guangdong special support program (2019BT02N112), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2021A1515010732) .",,48,8,8,16,50,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

This research article reveals the presence of a strong linear correlation among global e-waste generation and Gross Domestic Product. The obtained results indicate that the best fit for data can be reached by comparing e-waste collected volumes and GDP PPS. More in detail, an increase of 1000 GDP PPS means an additional 0.27 kg of e-waste collected and 0.22 kg of e-waste reused/recycled. Furthermore, for each additional citizen, there will be an increase of 7.7 kg of e-waste collected and 6.2 kg of e-waste reused/recycled. The better collection of e-waste acts an important role concerning the circular economy, and it can be an advantageous approach. Therefore, e-waste could be considered as an opportunity for recycling or recovery of valuable metals (e.g., copper, gold, silver, and palladium), given their significant content in precious metals than in mineral ores.

The collection is formed by an unparalleled set of more than 200 complete dishes and bowls, which were buried in the same place and at the same time, thus becoming of paramount archaeological interest. Consequently, this set of lustre pottery has become of pivotal importance for the study of this type of ceramic not only because of the number and integrity of the pieces that were found, but also by its homogeneity. This multidisciplinary study has revealed the importance of this pottery in terms of economy, trade, and social status in Modern times Catalonia. The main purpose of this paper is to determine provenance and technology of production of lustre and other glazed wares from Mas Llorens. We present the results of the archaeometrical characterization of 21 ceramic sherds, recovered from the excavations of Mas Llorens. The sampling includes 11 lustre ceramics, 4 blue-on-white tin-lead-glazed ceramics, and 6 plain lead glazed objects. Chemical and mineralogical composition of the ceramic pastes were analyzed by XRF, NAA, and XRD, and statically compared to 16th-17th tin-lead glazed pottery produced by the main Catalan workshops (e.g. Barcelona, Reus, Vilafranca del Penedes). The chemical data show a high homogeneity in the composition of lustreware pastes, as seen in other proto-industrial fine ceramic productions, evidencing a Barcelonan provenance. Chemical composition and microstructures of the glazes and lustre decorations were observed and analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA) and Elastic ion backscattering spectroscopy (EIBS). Successful lustre exhibits a red-copper color and metallic shine; it contains more copper than silver (average concentration, 9.5 wt% and 3.4 wt% respectively) with a ratio of wt% Cu/(Cu+Ag) = 62%, in the form of copper and silver nanoparticles which are concentrated in a thin layer (<300 nm) very close to the surface. On the contrary, in the unsuccessful brown lustre lacking metallic shine, although the copper to silver ratio is similar - wt% Cu/(Cu+Ag) = 63% -, the copper nanoparticles are distributed in a thick layer (1 micron thickness) but in lower concentration (average concentration in the layer 3.4 wt%), while the silver nanoparticles appear concentrated on a thinner surface layer. The lack of metallic shine in those samples is explained by the low concentration of silver and copper nanoparticles in the layer. This may be related to a deficient reducing firing capable of reducing copper to the metallic state and stopping its diffusion into the glaze.","[Molera, Judit] Univ Cent Catalunya, Univ Vic, Escola Politecn Super, GR MECAMAT, Catalonia, Spain; [Inanez, Javier] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, GPAC, Dept Geog, Prehist,Arqueol, Vitoria, Basque Country, Spain; [Inanez, Javier] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain; [Molina, Gloria; Pradell, Trinitat] Univ Politecn Cataluna, ESAB, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, Catalonia, Spain; [Burch, Josep; Alberch, Xavier] Univ Girona, IRH, Catalonia, Spain; [Glascock, Michael D.] Univ Missouri, Res Reactor Ctr, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC); University of Basque Country; Basque Foundation for Science; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat de Girona; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Molera, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Catalunya, Univ Vic, Escola Politecn Super, GR MECAMAT, Catalonia, Spain.",judit.molera@uvic.cat,"Molera, Judit/AAB-4676-2019; Pradell, Trinitat/D-4765-2014; Inanez, Javier/Y-1583-2018; Glascock, Michael D./O-8951-2014; Molera, Judit/K-9474-2013; Burch, Josep/E-9490-2016","Pradell, Trinitat/0000-0002-8720-5492; Inanez, Javier/0000-0002-1411-8099; Glascock, Michael D./0000-0003-0686-7556; Molera, Judit/0000-0003-3116-0456; Burch, Josep/0000-0003-4306-6678","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain) [MAT2013-41127-R]; 2014 SGR 00581; National Science Foundation [0102325, 0504015, 0802757]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0504015] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1415403, 0802757, 0102325] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain)(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); 2014 SGR 00581; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","JMM and TPC are indebted to the project MAT2013-41127-R funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain).

E-waste contains a significant content of printed circuit boards (PCBs), composed of metals and other valuable metals that may become scarce in Earth's crust - Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), and others. The main objective of this review is to explore the potential for producing nanoparticles (NPs) from the metals extracted through PCB recycling, with applications in the cosmetics, cement manufacturing, and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture industries. For this purpose, the recycling methods for PCBs e-waste, using physical processes (gravity, magnetic, electrostatic separation, and flotation), metallurgical processes (pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy), and purification techniques to obtain an enriched metal solution for the subsequent nanoparticle synthesis was performed. The production of NPs is a novel approach to obtain value-added products for industry. Therefore, recent research from pre-treatment of PCBs to NPs production is summarized, aligning with the circular economy principles and sustainable development goals. Towards this end, wasted PCBs can be transformed into valuable materials with innovative and potential applications in cosmetics, cement manufacturing, and carbon dioxide capture, contributing to a more sustainable future.","[Cunha, Lidia; Monteiro, Joana; Futuro, Aurora; Soeiro, Jose; Sousa, Rui] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, CERENA Polo FEUP Ctr Nat Resources & Environm, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Regufe, Maria Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Lab Separat & React Engn, Lab Catalysis & Mat, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Regufe, Maria Joao] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, ALiCE Associate Lab Chem Engn, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Cunha, L (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Engn, CERENA Polo FEUP Ctr Nat Resources & Environm, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",up201406702@up.pt,"Futuro Silva, Aurora/CAA-4432-2022; Sousa, Rui/HMP-7701-2023","Monteiro, Joana/0000-0003-2285-6232","Foundation for Science and Technology, I.

Given that the assets of households headed by individuals 55 years of age and over are much higher than those of average Korean households, it is essential for Korean financial institutions targeting elderly consumer groups to understand their credit card usage behavior, as it can be very attractive and provide the potential to lead to sustainable growth for institutions, while the market targeting for this group has not been well developed yet. This study examined elderly Korean consumers' credit card usage behavior in terms of key demographic variables. In this study, we found that the number of cards owned was negatively related to age and positively related to income level. In addition, those who were not retired owned more credit cards than those who were. Although the average monthly expenditure by credit cards was positively related to income, it was not significantly different in terms of age or retirement status. The findings from this research provide significant implications for marketers of credit card companies when searching for key target groups, particularly elderly consumers.","[Jung, Kwon] KDI Sch Publ Policy & Management, 263 Namsejong Ro, Sejong Si 30149, South Korea; [Kang, Moon Young] Soongsil Univ, Coll Business Adm, 369 Sangdo Ro, Seoul 06978, South Korea",KDI School of Public Policy & Management; Soongsil University,"Kang, MY (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Coll Business Adm, 369 Sangdo Ro, Seoul 06978, South Korea.",jungk@kdischool.ac.kr; mkang@ssu.ac.kr,"Kang, Moon/C-1818-2011","Kang, Moon Young/0000-0002-7653-5605",KDI School Research Fund,KDI School Research Fund,This research was supported by the KDI School Research Fund.,,29,2,2,4,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2021,13,7,,,,,,,3817,10.3390/su13073817,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13073817,,,9,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RL4EG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000638928100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The challenge of recycling LED lamps have emerged, and it is essential to address both environmental and economic aspects to achieve a circular economy. LED lamps contain precious and critical metals, which can be found in electrical components and in the LED itself, making them a prospective waste for recycling initiatives. However, data about the concentration and distribution of these metals in the LED lamp's components are still scarce and uncertain. This work aims to characterise the various components of different brands of LED lamps to provide novel data on the precious and critical metals' amounts. Gold and silver were found in all brands of lamp, and we highlight the occurrence of gold in all analysed components, in concentrations between 0.01% and 0.07%, which is relevant to the economic viability of future recycling routes (gold and silver can contribute with USD 4340.00 per ton of LED lamps). The critical metals gallium, yttrium, and cerium were found in LEDs, while cobalt, barium, gallium, antimony, and manganese were found in printed circuit boards (PCBs). Additionally, the elements lead, cadmium, and arsenic were characterised due to their association with environmental and human toxicity.","[Cenci, Marcelo Pilotto; Dal Berto, Frederico Christ; Castillo, Bianca Wurlitzer; Veit, Hugo Marcelo] Fed Univ Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Dept Mat Engn, LACOR, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Cenci, MP (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Dept Mat Engn, LACOR, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",marcelo.cenci@hotmail.com,"Cenci, Marcelo/AAM-6788-2021; Veit, Hugo Marcelo/H-1009-2012","Christ Dal Berto, Frederico/0000-0001-9336-1435; Pilotto Cenci, Marcelo/0000-0001-9251-3839; Veit, Hugo Marcelo/0000-0002-8843-8466",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [CAPES/PROEX 23038.000341/2019-71 0491/2019],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This work was supported by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [grant number CAPES/PROEX 23038.000341/2019-71 0491/2019].,,63,16,17,2,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3330,1479-487X,,ENVIRON TECHNOL,Environ.

In this contest, bioleaching promoted by bacteria may be regarded as a potential alternative to conventional cyanidation and chemical leaching. The capacity of a cyanogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), for cyanide production and Ag mobilization from electronic waste was assessed. Also, in order to maximize cyanide production, the influence of the initial pH and glycine concentration was studied and optimized via central composite design of a response surface methodology (CCD-RSM). In the optimal conditions (pH 8 and 1 g/L of glycine) P. aeruginosa produced around 10 mg/L cyanide. Therefore, the bioleaching experiments were performed under the synergistic effect of glycine and cyanide through a two-step process. In the first step the bacteria were grown in the optimized conditions and in the second step, after the maximum cyanide production was reached, WPCBs were added to the growth medium and the pH was set to 9. The optimization resulted in 90% Ag mobilization. In addition, the Au bioleaching was investigated and observed with an efficiency around 20%. Considering the current availability of WPCBs on the market, the results are very promising for the development of recycling processes in the spirit of circular economy.","[Merli, Giulia; Becci, Alessandro; Amato, Alessia] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Amato, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",a.amato@staff.univpm.it,"Becci, Alessandro/KBQ-0695-2024",,,,,,33,16,16,4,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",2213-2929,2213-3437,,J ENVIRON CHEM ENG,J.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the technical feasibility of producing ceramic foams from gold and silver tailings with high sulfide gangue through a previous flotation process to eliminate impurities associated to this gangue, as it can produce SO2 in the foaming process, and to analyze the effect of the sintering time and the temperature on the characteristics of foams obtained with this type of waste. The results showed that the inverse flotation reduced the presence of impurities associated to sulfides. In addition, it was possible to observe that in the absence of a foaming agent, it was possible to obtain ceramic foams with an apparent density and a mechanical strength near to 1.0 g/cm(3) and 0.5 MPa, respectively, when a higher sintering temperature and time were used. On the other hand, the presence of the foaming agent reduced the apparent density to 0.5 g/cm(3) without decreasing to a great extent the mechanical strength of ceramic foams at lower sintering temperatures.","[Salazar, Cristian; Uribe, Lina] Univ Talca, Sch Min Engn, Talca 3460000, Chile",Universidad de Talca,"Uribe, L (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Sch Min Engn, Talca 3460000, Chile.",crsalazar13@alumnos.utalca.cl; luribe@utalca.cl,,,,,,,17,1,1,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,NOV,2021,9,11,,,,,,,1897,10.3390/pr9111897,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr9111897,,,16,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,XI0ZP,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000725851400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicate that Ag/Zn deposits with diverse compositions and microstructures can be obtained at room temperature without any complexing agents, simply by varying EDRR parameters like deposition time, deposition potential, and redox replacement time. Two types of Ag/Zn intermetallics (Zn0.96Ag0.04 and Ag0.76Zn0.24) were identified by the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and anodic linear sweep voltammetry. Mass-transfer limitations have significant effects on the growth process, and a nucleation-growth mechanism from Ag/Zn particles into dendrites with increased EDRR cycles is introduced: with EDRR parameters favoring mass-transfer limitations (higher overpotentials, longer deposition times, and shorter redox replacement times), a more dendritic morphology of Ag/Zn alloys is achieved. The selective dissolution of Zn (i.e. dealloying) allowed the formation of silver-rich surfaces with an enhanced surface plasmon resonance behavior, which can be readily tuned by EDRR and dealloying parameters. These results highlight the significant potential of the EDRR-dealloying route to produce different types of Ag/Zn alloys and optically functional materials directly from base metal process solutions.","[Wang, Zulin; Hannula, Pyry-Mikko; Wilson, Benjamin P.; Lundstrom, Mari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Yliniemi, Kirsi; Rautama, Eeva-Leena] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Sci, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Lundström, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland.",mari.lundstrom@aalto.fi,"Lundström, Mari/L-6106-2015; Wilson, Benjamin/A-4974-2010; Yliniemi, Kirsi/I-7897-2012","Wilson, Benjamin/0000-0002-2874-6475; Hannula, Pyry-Mikko/0000-0001-9844-2234; Wang, Zulin/0000-0002-2234-7983; Yliniemi, Kirsi/0000-0003-2536-388X","Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC); Academy of Finland [319691, 339979]",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"Academy of Finland project (GoldTail (319691) BW) and EARMetal (339979, ML, KY) are greatly acknowledged for funding this research.

Whilst highly efficient, durable, and selective systems have been reported in organic media, the photocatalytic process performing efficiently in aqueous media is highly desirable for the purpose of its practical application. However, efficiency and selectivity for CO2 reduction versus proton reduction in aqueous solution have proven challenging to date. Herein, this study demonstrates the enablement of highly efficient and durable visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous media by a hybrid photocatalyst consisting of a silver-loaded conjugated polymer and a binuclear Ru(II) complex. The hybrid photocatalyst exhibited high activity and durability for formate production, with an apparent quantum yield of 4.2% at 460 nm and a turnover number of 38,000 (based on the amount of binuclear complexes adsorbed), both of which are the highest values reported amongst hybrid photocatalysts in aqueous media. Even though the conjugated polymer retains residual amounts of palladium from synthesis (which is an active site for H-2 production in aqueous media), the loading of Ag nanoparticles onto the conjugated polymer enhanced the activity and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction by suppressing H-2 production.","[Sakakibara, Noritaka] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Chem, 2-12-1-NE-2 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan; [Mcqueen, Ewan; Sprick, Reiner Sebastian] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Pure & Appl Chem, Thomas Graham Bldg,295 Cathedral St, Glasgow City G1 1XL, Scotland; [Ishitani, Osamu] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398526, Japan",Institute of Science Tokyo; Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of Strathclyde; Hiroshima University,"Sakakibara, N (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Chem, 2-12-1-NE-2 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan.;Sprick, RS (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Pure & Appl Chem, Thomas Graham Bldg,295 Cathedral St, Glasgow City G1 1XL, Scotland.;Ishitani, O (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Adv Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398526, Japan.",nori.sakakibara@gmail.com; sebastian.sprick@strath.ac.uk; iosamu@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Sprick, Reiner/A-2407-2019; Sakakibara, Noritaka/AAR-3977-2020; McQueen, Ewan/KHY-0278-2024; Ishitani, Osamu/C-4947-2011","Ishitani, Osamu/0000-0001-9557-7854; Sprick, Reiner Sebastian/0000-0002-5389-2706","JSPS KAKENHI [JPMXP1223MS1087]; Nanotechnology Platform Program; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Nanotechnology Platform Program; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","The authors thank the Open Facility Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology, for ICP-OES measurements.

Here, we address this issue using a newly developed powerful tracer in geoarchaeology, that of Pb isotopes applied to paleopollution. We measured the Pb isotopic compositions of a well-dated suite of eight deep cores taken in the Medjerda delta around the city of Utica. The data provide robust evidence of ancient lead-silver mining in Tunisia and lay out a chronology for its exploitation, which appears to follow the main periods of geopolitical instability at the time: the Greco-Punic Wars (480-307 BC) and the PunicWars (264-146 BC). During the last conflict, the data further suggest that Carthage was still able to pay indemnities and fund armies despite the loss of its traditional silver sources in the Mediterranean. This work shows that the mining of Tunisian metalliferous ores between the second half of the fourth and the beginning of the third century BC contributed to the emergence of Punic coinage and the development of the Carthaginian economy.","[Delile, Hugo; Pleuger, Elisa; Goiran, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, UMR 5133, Archeorient Maison Orient & Mediterranee, F-69365 Lyon 7, France; [Pleuger, Elisa; Fagel, Nathalie] Univ Liege, Dept Geol, Argiles Geochim & Environm Sedimentaires, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Blichert-Toft, Janne] Univ Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5276, Lab Geol Lyon,Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Gadhoum, Ahmed] Inst Natl Patrimoine, Dept Archeol Sous Marine, Tunis 1008, Tunisia; [Abichou, Abdelhakim] Fac Sci Humaines & Sociales Tunis, Lab Cartog Geomorphol Milieux Environm & Dynam, Tunis 1007, Tunisia; [Ben Jerbania, Imed] Inst Natl Patrimoine, Tunis 1008, Tunisia; [Wilson, Andrew I.] Univ Oxford, Fac Class, Oxford OX1 3LU, England; [Wilson, Andrew I.] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Oxford OX1 3TG, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of Liege; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Tunis; Institut National du Patrimoine; Universite de Tunis; Institut National du Patrimoine; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Delile, H (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, UMR 5133, Archeorient Maison Orient & Mediterranee, F-69365 Lyon 7, France.",hugo.delile@mom.fr,"Wilson, Andrew/N-3523-2019; Blichert-Toft, Janne/C-8280-2012; Wilson, Andrew/A-5216-2014","Blichert-Toft, Janne/0000-0002-4932-4079; fagel, nathalie/0000-0002-8231-8295; Wilson, Andrew/0000-0001-5237-2234",Roman Mediterranean Ports Program (European Research Council) [339123]; French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE); European Research Council (ERC) [339123] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Roman Mediterranean Ports Program (European Research Council); French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We are grateful to Philippe Telouk for ensuring that the mass spectrometers were always working well.

A full understanding of the relationship between ecology and economy is necessary for the coordinated development of the two. This paper takes Sichuan Province as the research area and county-level administrative districts as the research unit. Based on the medium value of the ecological quality index and economic growth index of each unit, Sichuan Province is divided into dual pressure zones (DPZ), economic backward zones (EBZ), ecological crisis zones (ECZ), and coordinated development zones (CDZ) and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of each unit is studied. The results show that: (1) On the whole, the eastern part of Sichuan Province has a better level of economic development, and the southern part of the western region has a higher ecological quality. The ecological quality and economic growth pattern are highly correlated with topographical conditions. (2) The distribution characteristics of the four types of partitions are significantly different. The EBZ are more distributed in the western and southern of Sichuan Province, the ECZ are more distributed in the eastern, the DPZ and CDZ are relatively more sporadic. More than 90% of the partition changed zones are distributed in the eastern area. (3) The CCD of more than 95% units belongs to moderate coordination and high coordination. The overall CCD of the four types of zones has shown an upward trend from 2010 to 2015. Based on the results, Sichuan Province should follow the path of clear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver, and targeted sustainable development suggestions for DPZ, EBZ, ECZ, and CDZ are put forward. This paper provides guidance for formulating regional sustainable development strategies, especially in areas with unbalanced development due to congenital topographical conditions.","[Liu, Yunzhi; Sun, Meiying; Li, Xiuhong; Meng, Lingyu; Wang, Yizhuo; Liu, Qiang] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, 19 Xinjiekou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rongjin; Sun, Meiying; Zhang, Le] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, 8 Da Yang Fang, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences,"Li, XH (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, 19 Xinjiekou Wai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lixh@bnu.edu.cn,"Li, Xiuhong/ABB-8030-2020; liu, qiang/HCH-3916-2022",,National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC3201500]; National Key Research and Development Project [2016YFC0502106]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Aerospace Information Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Key Research and Development Project(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Aerospace Information Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,This research was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC3201500); the National Key Research and Development Project (No. 2016YFC0502106); and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Plastic production requires carbon raw materials and energy that are associated today with predominantly fossil raw materials and fossil GHG emissions. Worldwide, the plastic demand is increasing annually by 4%. Recycling technologies can help save or reduce GHG emissions, but they require comparative assessment. Thus, we assess mechanical recycling, chemical recycling by means of pyrolysis and a consecutive, complementary combination of both concerning Global Warming Potential (GWP) [CO(2)e], Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) [MJ/kg], carbon efficiency [%], and product costs [euro] in a process-oriented approach and within defined system boundaries. The developed techno-economic and environmental assessment approach is demonstrated in a case study on recycling of separately collected mixed lightweight packaging (LWP) waste in Germany. In the recycling paths, the bulk materials polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS) are assessed. The combined mechanical and chemical recycling (pyrolysis) of LWP waste shows considerable saving potentials in GWP (0.48 kg CO(2)e/kg input), CED (13.32 MJ/kg input), and cost (0.14 euro/kg input) and a 16% higher carbon efficiency compared to the baseline scenario with state-of-the-art mechanical recycling in Germany. This leads to a combined recycling potential between 2.5 and 2.8 million metric tons/year that could keep between 0.8 and 2 million metric tons/year additionally in the (circular) economy instead of incinerating them. This would be sufficient to reach both EU and German recycling rate targets (EC 2018).

Dumping e waste on islands can cause pollution of ground and surface water and degradation of coastal and marine resources. Yet, research that supports island governments to deal with their e-waste is scarce. This paper explores the viability of a circular economy (CE) and asks whether this could be a promising solution for islands to tackle their e-waste challenge. In pursuit of this aim, the CE potential of e-waste is analyzed on five Caribbean islands: Aruba, Barbados, Grenada, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. The resource quantity of e-waste generated between 2020 and 2025 is estimated, and the economic value is assessed for the embedded materials. Using sensitivity analyses, three scenarios of exploitable e-waste and their potential economic values were calculated, considering the recovery of 20%, 50%, or 100% of e-waste stocked on the islands between 2001 and 2019. Expert interviews were conducted to identify existing e-waste management practices, if any. The results reveal that more than 317.4 kt of secondary materials would be available for recovery, comprising a significant amount of base and precious metals, such as aluminum, copper, silver, gold, and palladium. The estimated economic value of these materials is estimated to be more than $546 million. However, according to the sensitivity analysis, if these islands had started the recovery of resources in early 2001, this value would almost triple to $1,430 million equivalent to nearly 30% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) from mining and quarrying in the entire Caribbean community, from just these five islands. Due to economies of scale that limit smaller nations, regional co-operations and initiating industrial symbiosis would be essential for desirous islands to shift to a CE. CE can support resource self-sufficiency on islands and bring several social, environmental, and economic benefits. This research is the first to provide an island-specific perspective to help decision-makers manage e-waste flows by including participatory CE implementation methods.","[Mohammadi, Elham; Singh, Simron Jit; Habib, Komal] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Mohammadi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",elham.mohammadi@uwaterloo.ca,"Mohammadi, Elham/AAB-9004-2022","Mohammadi, Elham/0000-0002-7809-8250",,,,,92,19,19,5,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Photocatalytic reduction of hazardous 4-NP by nano-sized materials to produce 4-aminophenol (4-AP), which is a commercially valuable product, is a promising alternative as the process is framed within the circular economy. In this context, Ag-doped TiO2 (AT) catalysts were synthesized by liquid impregnation and reduction techniques, and their structure, morphology, elemental composition, textural, and light absorption properties were evaluated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, and DRS spectroscopy. AT catalysts exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic reduction of 4-NP into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of NaBH4. Among the tested catalysts, AT21 prepared by a simple aqueous reduction method showed the highest activity reaching about 98% 4-NP reduction within 10 min. Antibacterial tests of these catalysts against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that AT21 also exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration, suggesting that it has the strongest antibacterial activity. These findings suggest that AT21 catalyst with improved catalytic and antibacterial properties can potentially be utilized for the remediation of 4-NP-contaminated water environment.","[Mergenbayeva, Saule; Bekaliyev, Akhmet; Junissov, Arslan; Poulopoulos, Stavros G.] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn & Digital Sci, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan; [Begenova, Dilnaz; Pham, Tri T.] Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Sci & Humanities, Dept Biol, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan",Nazarbayev University; Nazarbayev University,"Poulopoulos, SG (通讯作者)，Nazarbayev Univ, Sch Engn & Digital Sci, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.",stavros.poulopoulos@nu.edu.kz,"Poulopoulos, Stavros/J-7386-2019; Pham, Tri/JNE-5683-2023","Poulopoulos, Stavros/0000-0001-7010-855X",Nazarbayev University; Core Facilities of Nazarbayev University,Nazarbayev University; Core Facilities of Nazarbayev University,The technical support from the Core Facilities of Nazarbayev University is greatly acknowledged.

As financial markets become more complex and the global economy develops, the importance of household finance has become increasingly prominent. Households are not only consumption units but also key participants in financial markets. Their decisions on portfolio choice, savings, consumption, and risk management not only affect their own economic well-being but also have a profound impact on macroeconomic stability and the development of financial markets. This study applies bibliometric analysis and network visualization technology (CiteSpace) to systematically review 3470 articles on household finance published from 2006 to 2024 in the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results show that the number of publications in this field has been steadily increasing. Research hotspots include financial technology, financial literacy, and the impact of macroeconomic factors. this study identifies three future directions for the field. To begin with, the integration of household finance and the silver economy in the context of aging. In addition, research on sustainable consumption and green investment by households in the context of green finance. Lastly, the application of artificial intelligence in household financial decision-making.

This paper sheds light on this question by introducing a novel typology of monetary-fiscal coordination that can help us make sense of formal and informal coordination efforts in the post-2008 era. It zooms in on a peculiar but key aspect which monetary and fiscal authorities have sought to achieve coordination on: The fiscal backing of central banks' balance sheets to insure monetary policy against losses and 'insolvency'. To understand central bankers' aversion towards loss-making despite their ability to create currency, the paper develops a political economy account which emphasizes policy-makers' interpretations of their own independence and their desire for fiscal protection, in contrast to traditional accounts of delegation that treat independent agents as discretion-seekers and power-maximizers. The typology is illustrated with case studies of the European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan between 2008 and 2023, each representing a different type of monetary-fiscal coordination post-crisis.","[Diessner, Sebastian] Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, The Hague, Netherlands; [Diessner, Sebastian] Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, Turfmarkt 99, NL-2511 DP The Hague, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Diessner, S (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, Turfmarkt 99, NL-2511 DP The Hague, Netherlands.",s.diessner@fgga.leidenuniv.nl,,"Diessner, Sebastian/0000-0002-9458-980X",,,,,157,1,1,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Bioenergy is designated as a smart option to mitigate energy-based demands of an escalating human population, the resultant environmental pollution, and challenges of climate change. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first concerted and comparative assessment of Jatropha curcas, Pongamia pinnata and Mesua ferrea as biofuel resources, with concurrent evaluation of the environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. Ease of availability, non-edibility, higher biomass, and resilience to climatic variations, render them potential biofuel capital for a cleaner and greener future. Their environmental perspectives are critically assessed in this review based on the roles in phytoremediation, bioadsorption, carbon sequestration, and soil conditioning. The detailed analysis of biogas, biopesticide, cosmetic products, and biofuel yield, reinforce the economic potential of the three plants under review. The socioeconomic implications, practical challenges, and limitations of crops for biofuel, especially in the predominantly rural, low income, agrarian milieu, are comprehensively discussed. Therefore, in the concluding section, the review offers new directions for policies and frameworks toward sustainable and circular bio-economy in biofuel sector.","[Mitra, Sudip; Ghose, Anamika; Gujre, Nihal; Borah, Pallabi] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati IITG, Sch Agro & Rural Technol, Agroecotechnol Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India; [Senthilkumar, Sanjana; Rangan, Latha] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati IITG, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Appl Biodivers Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India; [Borah, Pallabi] Royal Global Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Gauhati 781035, Assam, India; [Paul, Ankita] Indian Agr Res Inst IARI, Ctr Environm Sci & Climate Resilient Agr, New Delhi 110012, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute,"Mitra, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Guwahati IITG, Sch Agro & Rural Technol, Agroecotechnol Lab, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India.",sudipmitra@yahoo.com,"Rangan, Latha/B-3211-2008; Gujre, Nihal/IXN-1146-2023; PAUL, ANKITA/KRP-0459-2024","Ghose, Anamika/0000-0002-3616-3085; Mitra, Sudip/0000-0002-1838-8264","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR25417/NER/95/1185/2017]","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India)","Sudip Mitra thanks Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for generous funding support (BT/PR25417/NER/95/1185/2017).

This importance has led to the need to advance in the development of environmentally sustainable and safe nanomaterials by incorporat-ing the principles of green chemistry during their synthesis and in their applications. However, this qualitative framework of thought does not offer minimum criteria for the use of the term green, and therefore, this adjec-tive is commonly used to refer to bio-based or nanotechnological processes without taking into account their net ecological impact. In this context, environmental sustainability metrics can be applied to nanotechnology to com-pare, optimize and quantify the environmental sustainability of synthesis procedures. This review provides an overview of green chemistry and its application in nanotechnology, but also an analysis of the use of green chem-istry principles in the development of bio-based nanobiotechnology and nanosynthesis, with special emphasis on the use of sustainability's metrics for the quantitative analysis of nanomaterial synthesis protocols.

We demonstrate its usefulness for extracting bio-molecules contained in silver fir growing in France. Context Numerous bio-active molecules can be extracted from trees at an industrial scale. Supply chain actors play a central role in this emerging bio-economy. However, they do not have enough information and tools to make informed decisions with respect to species, growing locations, or identities of potential suppliers of relevant wood biomass. Aims We explore and demonstrate an information chain and methodological framework that can help make three critical decisions regarding the selection of (1) the species containing the desired bio-molecules, (2) the locations where the resource is collected, and (3) the supply chain partners and types of industrial wood by-products necessary to obtain sufficient biomass for industrial extraction. Methods The methodological framework provides detailed guidelines and references to select the right combination of sampling protocol, allometric models, chemical analyses, GIS tools, and forest growth and supply chain models in order to produce information for the three decision steps within various regional contexts. Results We apply the framework within the context of supply chain actors who are interested in estimating the quantity and diversity of bio-molecules contained in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) growing in the Grand Est region of France. We show how conflicting environmental, legal and economic constraints can affect the results. We discuss future challenges that need to be tackled to improve the methodological framework. Conclusion This study represents a highly detailed overview of the potential bio-molecules contained in a tree species, from its natural habitat or plantation to the end of the regional supply chain. It also represents a step towards the development of a generic knowledge infrastructure and methodology that is necessary to solve various decision-making problems regarding the industrial supply and extraction of high-value bio-molecules.","[Pichancourt, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Ctr Clermont Ferrand, INRAE, Complex Syst Lab UR LISC, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal CS 20085, F-63178 Aubiere, France; [Bauer, Rodolphe; Billard, Antoine; Contini, Adrien; Longuetaud, Fleur; Richard, Beatrice; Wernsdorfer, Holger; Colin, Francis] Univ Lorraine, INRAE, AgroParisTech, UMR 1434 SILVA, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Brennan, Maree; Cosgun, Sylvain; Dumarcay, Stephane; Gerardin, Philippe; Hentges, David Jean] Univ Lorraine, Fac Sci & Technol, INRAE, EA 4370 USC,1445 LERMAB, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Colin, Antoine; Cuny, Henri] IGN, Pole Expertise Ressources Forestieres & Carbone, F-54250 Champigneulles, France; [Fortin, Mathieu] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, 580 Booth St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E4, Canada; [Caurla, Sylvain] INRAE, UMR 7522, Bur Etud Econ Theor & Appl BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite de Lorraine; INRAE; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); INRAE,"Pichancourt, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, Ctr Clermont Ferrand, INRAE, Complex Syst Lab UR LISC, 9 Ave Blaise Pascal CS 20085, F-63178 Aubiere, France.",jean-baptiste.pichancourt@inrae.fr,"Brennan, Maree/N-7529-2019; RICHARD, BEATRICE/IWD-6364-2023; Pichancourt, Jean-Baptiste/J-7715-2016; Brennan, Maree/J-8739-2016","Brennan, Maree/0000-0002-2596-8910; Longuetaud, Fleur/0000-0002-6570-2746; Pichancourt, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-9276-8628","French Ministry of Agriculture (contractual project EXTRAFOREST/MAAF); Lorraine-FEDER (contractual project EXTRAFOREST/FEDER); French National Research Agency (ANR), Investissements d'Avenir programme [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]; Lab of Excellence ARBRE (contractual project BARK-TAN-BIO)","French Ministry of Agriculture (contractual project EXTRAFOREST/MAAF); Lorraine-FEDER (contractual project EXTRAFOREST/FEDER); French National Research Agency (ANR), Investissements d'Avenir programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Lab of Excellence ARBRE (contractual project BARK-TAN-BIO)","ExtraFor-Est is a 1.55 million euros research projet that was managed by UMR 1434 Silva and EA 4370 LERMAB.

Smart grids are seen as the silver bullet responding to the challenge of integrating renewables, managing flexibility, and keeping the costs down in distribution networks. Network unbundling on the other hand is essential for competition in the liberalized electricity industry. It forces independence of the networks and thereby eliminates concern that incumbent integrated (network) firms discriminate against new entrants. With smart grids the unbundling questions become relevant for distribution networks, because active control in smart grids entails discrimination potentials. However, smart grids exhibit coordination needs for efficient system operation and unbundling eliminates firm-internal coordination. Accounting for both aspects, this paper proposes an independent system operator to govern smart distribution grids. It eliminates discrimination incentives and serves coordination needs, thereby striking a balance between both competition and efficiency goals.","Bremer Energie Inst, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",,"Friedrichsen, N (通讯作者)，Bremer Energie Inst, Coll Ring 2,Res V, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",friedrichsen@bremer-energie-institut.de,,,Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM; German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks [FKZ 0328007A],Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM; German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks,"Financial assistance from Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM and from the German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks (grant number: FKZ 0328007A) is gratefully acknowledged.

Nanoparticles, hence, against ticks may better be considered as nanopesticides that act in ways other than conventional drug efficacies. The methods of nanoparticles production include green synthesis, chemical synthesis, and arthropod-based synthesis. Pros and cons of these nanopesticides are by no means neglectable. Studies are fewer than needed to comprehensively discuss nanopesticides.

X-ray technology in this respect is commonly used for nondestructive testing to identify physical defects and anomalies in integrated circuits. However, for accurate material identification, destructive methods such as spectroscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence are typically required. In this work, a fast and non-destructive method is presented for material characterization of bonding wires in ICs and other SMD components by measuring X-ray absorption profiles. The results demonstrated that the X-ray imaging technique can effectively distinguish between bonding wires made of gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. Moreover, the thickness of these materials can also be detected. This technique exhibits high potential for utilization as a simple and quick method for non-destructive material characterization in the industrial environment.","[Muss, D.; Koch, R.] Fraunhofer Inst Elect Microsyst & Solid State Tech, Hansastr 27d, D-80686 Munich, Germany",,"Muss, D (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Elect Microsyst & Solid State Tech, Hansastr 27d, D-80686 Munich, Germany.",dominik.muss@emft.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,26,3,3,3,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0026-2714,1872-941X,,MICROELECTRON RELIAB,Microelectron.

We find that the U.S. and Chinese economies in particular influence the precious metal markets, but in opposite directions. The stock markets and trade balance of both G7 and BRICS countries, as well as the consumer confidence of G7 countries, are the key drivers for the volatility of precious metals. The most influential drivers for correlation are stock markets, money supply, and the inflation rate. Surprisingly, the economic policy uncertainty does not affect the dynamics as much as expected.

Subsequently, the morphology of the treated samples was characterized through SEM and XPS to explore the pretreatment process of the carbon fiber surface. The results indicated that the carbon fiber exhibited the optimal debinding effect at 55 degrees C and the heating time was longer than 120 min. The result indicated that coarsening effect of 65% concentrated nitric acid was the optimal.

The network of Armenian commerce did not have a single strong centre with many peripheries, but a chain of multiple nodes functioning as crucial linking points. This paper focuses on one particular trade route, from Madras to Manila, in the eighteenth century. The Philippines attracted Spanish American silver, which was then pumped into various regional economies of Asia China and India in particular - in the shape of investment. A Spanish ban on European shipping at Manila made Armenians (and Indians) indispensable partners for European trade to Manila. This gave Armenian trade to Manila a strong European flavour. Armenians helped to camouflage this trade, and enriched themselves from it at the same time, operating often independently of New Julfa.","Int Inst Social Hist, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; International Institute of Social History (IISH-KNAW),"Bhattacharya, B (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Hist, Cruquiusweg 31, NL-1019 AT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",B.Bhattacharya@let.leidenuniv.nl,"Bhattacharya, Basudev/IAO-1201-2023",,,,,,46,21,28,1,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1740-0228,1740-0236,,J GLOBAL HIST,J.

Plastic use is diverse - varied polymers, product and packaging design, pathways to the environment, and impacts - therefore there is no silver bullet solution. Policies addressing plastic pollution as a single phenomenon respond to this complexity with greater reliance on downstream mitigations, like recycling and cleanup. Here, we present a framework of dividing plastic use in society into sectors, which can be used to disentangle the complexity of plastic pollution and direct attention to upstream design for the circular economy. Monitoring plastic pollution in environmental compartments will continue to provide feedback on mitigations, but with a sector framework, scientists, industry, and policymakers can begin to shape actions to curb the harmful impacts of plastic pollution at the source.","[Erdle, Lisa M.; Eriksen, Marcus] 5 Gyres Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90016 USA",,"Erdle, LM; Eriksen, M (通讯作者)，5 Gyres Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90016 USA.",lisa@5gyres.org; marcus@5gyres.org,,,5 Gyres Institute,5 Gyres Institute,"This work was supported by The 5 Gyres Institute.

The enrichment of Te on the electrode (with 100 EDRR cycles) had a calculated global warming potential of 3.7 CO2 -eqv from a solution with 500 ppm Te based on a Finnish energy mix. In comparison, a decrease of Te concentration to 100 ppm increased the corresponding environmental impact to 16.9 CO2 -eqv.

In addition, conventional energy, such as oil and gas, are intensive inputs to metal production, making these variables increasingly interconnected for economies and financial investment. This study analyzes the dynamics of the connectedness generated by economic instability and geopolitical risk on the traditional non-renewable energy and precious metals markets using TimeVarying Parameter Vector Autoregressive (TVP-VAR) and Wavelets Coherences from 11 June 2012 to 23 May 2022. The results show that the total connectedness index was higher during the Russia-Ukrainian conflict in February-May 2022. Moreover, the geopolitical risk, financial instability, and oil return are net transmitters of shocks, while gold, gas, and silver are the net received. The wavelet coherence results show strong co-movement during the Russia-Ukrainian conflict between geopolitical risk, oil, gas, and silver returns at various scales, given its properties for diversification at the time-frequency domain. Gold appears a stable asset and serves as a haven ability against geopolitical risk and financial instability. Findings indicate that geopolitical risk and financial instability are crucial in determining metals, precious, and energy markets that the investors, managers, funds, and producers need to consider in their investment and production decisions. Policymakers and macroprudential authorities should consider a shifting macroeconomic environment.","[Shahzad, Umer] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Mohammed, Kamel Si] Univ Ain Temouchent, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Temouchent, Algeria; [Tiwari, Sunil] Cent Univ Kerala, Dept Tourism Studies, Kasaragod, India; [Nakonieczny, Joanna] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Dept Finance Banking & Accountancy, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland; [Nesterowicz, Renata] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Econ & Finance, Dept Finance & Accounting, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Centre Universitaire Ain Temouchent; Central University of Kerala; Rzeszow University of Technology; University of Rzeszow,"Shahzad, U (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Appl Math, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",shehzad-umer@hotmail.com; kamel.simohammed@univ-temouchent.edu.dz; tiwari.sunil10@outlook.com; j.nakonieczny@prz.edu.pl; rbnester@onet.eu,"Si Mohammed, Kamel/HPD-2107-2023; Tiwari, Sunil/HMW-0468-2023; Shahzad, Umer/ABC-8034-2020","Si Mohammed, Kamel/0000-0002-4359-9151; Shahzad, Umer/0000-0002-7010-4054; , Sunil Tiwari/0000-0002-0180-9237; Nakonieczny, Joanna/0000-0002-5069-2514",,,,,92,147,151,19,156,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

Specifically, aging populations in developed countries face an increasingly serious problem due to the increasing budget for patient care and an inadequate labor force, and therefore a solution is urgently needed. Recently, diverse techniques for the detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers have been researched and developed to support early diagnosis and treatment. Among them, electrochemical biosensors and electrode modification proved their effectiveness in the detection of the A beta biomarker at appropriately low concentrations for practice and point-of-care application. This review discusses the production and detection ability of amyloid beta, an Alzheimer's biomarker, by electrochemical biosensors with SAM support for antibody conjugation. In addition, future perspectives on SAM for the improvement of electrochemical biosensors are also proposed and discussed.","[Le, Phan Gia; Le, Hien T.

A study of the capacities, or affordances of this plant within diverse political economies highlights its mutability in some circumstances and vulnerability in others. The contrasts are stark. In South America, peasant agriculture took the potato across a large and diverse ecumene allowing its elaboration into many varieties and sustaining extensive state systems that taxed its production. Spanish colonialism repurposed the plant as the calorific basis for concentrations of coerced labour at silver mines. Back in Europe it was initially the resistance of the potato to state violence that encouraged peasants to turn over their fields to a tuberous plant that concealed its food underground. But its calorific productivity per acre again saw it repurposed as peasants were converted to proletarians, allowed to subsist on only the smallest plots while working for landlords on larger estates.","[Nally, David] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Kearns, Gerry] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",University of Cambridge; Maynooth University,"Nally, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England.",dpn24@cam.ac.uk; gerry.kearns@nuim.ie,,,,,,,129,14,15,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0066-4812,1467-8330,,ANTIPODE,Antipode,SEP,2020,52,5,,,,,1373,1392,,10.1111/anti.12652,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anti.12652,,AUG 2020,20,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,MX0OV,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000556426800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we present the different steps for the design of an aptamer-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (BioSERS) sensing chip capable of detecting the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) in spiked phosphate-buffered solutions and real samples of human blood serum. Optimization of the preparation steps in terms of the aptamer concentration used for the functionalization of the silver nanoparticles, time for affixing the aptamer, incubation time with target protein, and insulation of the silver active surface with cysteamine, led to a sensitive BioSERS chip, which was able to detect the N protein in the range from 1 to 75 ng mL-1 in spiked phosphate-buffered solutions with a detection limit of 1 ng mL-1 within 30 min. Furthermore, the BioSERS chip was used to detect the target protein in scarcely spiked human serum. This study demonstrates the possibility of a clinical application that can improve the detection limit and accuracy of the currently commercialized SARS-CoV-2 immunodiagnostic kit. Additionally, the system is modular and can be applied to detect other proteins by only changing the aptamer. A sensitive and selective bioSERS chip was developed for the detection of nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV-2 virus, applied to sense the N protein in human blood serum.","[Kouz, Sadok; Ouhibi, Awatef; Moadhen, Adel] Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Tunis, Lab Nanomat Nanotechnol & Energy L2NE, Tunis El Manar 2092, Tunisia; [Kouz, Sadok; Lorrain, Nathalie; Guendouz, Mohammed] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6082, ENSSAT FOTON,Lab Optron, BP 80518,6 Rue Kerampont, F-22305 Lannion, France; [Raouafi, Amal; Raouafi, Noureddine] Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Tunis, Lab Analyt Chem & Electrochem LR99ES15, Sensor & Biosensors Grp, Tunis El Manar 2092, Tunisia; [Essafi, Makram; Mejri, Manel] Univ Tunis El Manar, Pasteur Inst Tunis, LTCII, LR11 IPT02, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Faculte des Sciences de Tunis (FST); Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Faculte des Sciences de Tunis (FST); Pasteur Network; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Institut Pasteur Tunis,"Moadhen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Tunis, Lab Nanomat Nanotechnol & Energy L2NE, Tunis El Manar 2092, Tunisia.;Guendouz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6082, ENSSAT FOTON,Lab Optron, BP 80518,6 Rue Kerampont, F-22305 Lannion, France.;Raouafi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, Fac Sci Tunis, Lab Analyt Chem & Electrochem LR99ES15, Sensor & Biosensors Grp, Tunis El Manar 2092, Tunisia.",noureddine.raouafi@fst.utm.tn; adel.modhen@istmt.utm.tn; mohammed.guendouz@univ-rennes.fr,"Raouafi, Noureddine/MEO-1280-2025; Ouhibi, Awatef/AAC-8538-2022; Raouafi, Noureddine/G-4062-2010","Raouafi, Noureddine/0000-0001-8938-8221",University of Tunis El Manar [21MAG07],University of Tunis El Manar(Universite de Tunis-El-Manar),"The authors express gratitude to the University of Tunis El Manar for the generous support through the mobility grant.

In this work, films based on Kuzu starch with rooibos extract and chili pepper oil extract were prepared and tested. Starch foil with silver nanoparticles and foil without additives were used as a comparative material. The chemical structures (ATR-FTIR) of the materials obtained, their thermal (DSC) and mechanical properties (tensile strength, hardness), density, swelling, water vapor permeability, water solubility, and effects on bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were examined. The Kuzu rooibos film had the lowest antimicrobial activity. At the same time, it was the most flexible foil and was characterized by having the best water vapor permeability and water absorption capacity. The starch film with chili extract was the weakest mechanically speaking, but it significantly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 bacteria at a level similar to that of the film with silver nanoparticles.

The examined discourses focus on consumer practices and value preferences attributed to the negatively defined, ethnic other, and give a central role to strategies such as classification (or definition) struggles, moral criticism and stereotyping. The analysis demonstrates how members of these groups attach different meanings to the concept of a good/normal/ideal life, and to dichotomies such as average standard of living and luxuries, morally acceptable and morally stigmatized modes of consumption, and consumer modernism and conservatism when they explain their consumer choices. The analysis furthermore shows how - through the strategies mentioned above - these Roma construct their respective ethnic interpretations of consumer moral superiority.","[Berta, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Berta, P (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Ethnol, Orszaghaz St 30, H-1014 Budapest, Hungary.",peterberta@yahoo.com,"Berta, Péter/AGS-8739-2022",,,,,,31,6,6,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1469-5405,1741-2900,,J CONSUM CULT,J.

Thus, in concern over public health and the economy, controlling the emergence of infectious diseases is critical worldwide. One of the ways to overcome the influences of antimicrobial resistance is by developing new, efficient, and improved antimicrobial agents. Medicinal plant-derived silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are under intensive examination for a variety of therapeutic purposes and targeted applications in nanomedicine and nanotechnology. Plants belonging to the genus Thevetia [Syn. Casabela], which is known for its medicinal uses and has rarely been applied for the synthesis of AgNPs, is an attractive alternative as they have a high content of secondary metabolites. Herein, using aqueous leaf extract of Cascabela thevetia, which was locally found in the Makkah region, Saudi Arabia, green synthesis of AgNPs is reported. Active components of Cascabela thevetia aqueous leaf extract were sufficient to reduce AgNO3 into AgNPs and stabilize them as this was confirmed through UV-Visible absorption, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), filed emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. UV-Visible, HPLC, and FTIR analysis demonstrated the presence of gallic acid in aqueous extract and solution of C-AgNPs. The spherical Cascabela thevetia derived C-AgNPs with an average diameter in the range of 20-30 nm were highly dispersed, as seen from FESEM and TEM images, and demonstrated the high antibacterial and antifungal activities when incubated with Gram-positive bacteria Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and fungi Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis). The lowest MIC values of C-AgNPs versus S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli were found. Finally, the antioxidant activity and catalytic property of C-AgNPs were assessed by neutralizing DPPH free radical and reducing methylene blue and rhodamine B dyes, respectively.","[Khan, Amna Nisar; Aldowairy, Najla Nader Ali; Alorfi, Hajer Saed Saad; Bawazir, Wafa AbuBaker] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Aslam, Mohammad; Hameed, Abdul; Soomro, Muhammad Tahir] King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Environm Studies, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Hameed, Abdul] Quaid i Azam Univ, Natl Ctr Phys, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; National Centre for Physics - Pakistan; Quaid I Azam University,"Soomro, MT (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Environm Studies, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",mssoomro@kau.edu.sa,"Soomro, Muhammad Tahir/H-2299-2017; Bawazir, Wafa/AAU-7548-2020; Alorfi, Hajer/AAX-4797-2020; Abdul, Hameed/I-8049-2015; Bawazir, Wafa/H-1429-2018; Aslam, Mohammad/L-2447-2014","Bawazir, Wafa/0000-0001-7415-1782; Aslam, Mohammad/0000-0002-7167-4374",,,,,80,9,9,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,OCT,2022,10,10,,,,,,,1949,10.3390/pr10101949,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10101949,,,24,"Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,5R2IX,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000874340400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this reason, LED recycling process can contribute as secondary source of critical metals. Also, recycling can benefit the decrease in the amount of waste generated. The recycling process is designed according to the characteristics of the material. For this reason, this work aims the characterization of waste LED from different brands in order to study a recycling route.

It is less well understood how Cameralism, as a policy of order and development, and monetary theory went together. The present paper will sketch these working mechanisms as well as provide a few angles for new perspectives and future research. A first section after the brief introduction studies general issues of development in relation to balance-of-payment constraints (II), followed by the discourses on whether the domestic currency ought to remain stable in terms of intrinsic (silver) value (III), or whether it may be debased so as to raise domestic exports and competitiveness (IV). Both options were considered, at times and by varying actors, as valid strategies of promoting economic development, especially export-led growth, although most contemporaries viewed coin debasement as harmful to the economy. A fifth section discusses an alternative to the aforementioned strategies, that of raising effective monetary mass through increasing velocity. Since the Middle Ages and into the nineteenth century, the German economic tradition had a clear understanding of how velocity could be managed and the common weal stimulated by an increase in vivacity of circulation (V). In hindsight, it appears that we find here a powerful program towards promoting economic development and Europe's rise towards capitalism. A conclusion will offer some thoughts for further research (VI).","[Roessner, Philip Robinson] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Rössner, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,156,7,7,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1053-8372,1469-9656,,J HIST ECON THOUGHT,J.

Hydrogen generation through water splitting is quite popular, and it has the potential to produce green hydrogen at a very low cost. The development of low-cost, high efficiency electrocatalysts is very important for water splitting processes. Hence, this paper focuses on a novel approach to develop low-cost silver (Ag) nanoparticles doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER activity of pristine MoS2 nanostructures has also been tested to compare the results with Ag-MoS2 nanocomposites. The materials (MoS2, Ag-MoS2) have been synthesized using pulsed laser ablation in liquid, which is a sustainable technique to synthesize nanomaterials. The developed electrocatalysts have been characterized using various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction to know their morphology, optical properties, and structural properties. The electrochemical performance study was analyzed in a standard three electrode cell with 0.5M H2SO4. From electrochemical measurement study, it has been observed that Ag-MoS2 has an overpotential of 0.222 V, which is less than that of MoS2 nanosheets (0.274 V). The Tafel slope is also the least for Ag-MoS2 as compared to MoS2. The charge transfer resistance for Ag-MoS2 is 13.05 Omega, while MoS2 provides the resistance of 39.93 Omega. The developed Ag-MoS2 electrocatalyst may be a promising material to generate green hydrogen at the industrial scale.","[Mehta, Kavil; Baruah, Prahlad K.] Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Phys, Raisan 382426, Gujarat, India; [Kumar, Prashant; Kushawaha, Rajesh K.] Phys Res Lab, Atom Mol & Opt Phys Div, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India","Pandit Deendayal Energy University; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India","Baruah, PK (通讯作者)，Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Phys, Raisan 382426, Gujarat, India.",Prahlad.Baruah@sot.pdpu.ac.in,"Mehta, Kavil/AES-7676-2022; Baruah, Prahlad/AAB-6199-2019","Mehta, Kavil/0000-0003-0647-3143; Kushawaha, Rajesh Kumar/0000-0002-8134-9030; Baruah, Prahlad/0000-0001-8826-9634",Government of Gujarat,Government of Gujarat,"Kavil Mehta and Prahlad K.

In this paper, the exploration is conducted regarding the application of surface-enhancement technology in the quantitative detection of the aging characteristics of transformer oil-paper insulation. Flower-like silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were deposited in situ on a copper foil coated with porous graphene, thereby fabricating a Cu-graphene (porous)-AgNPs surface-enhanced substrate. This substrate effectively prevented the oxidation of nanoparticles while maintaining the SERS activity. By creating apertures in graphene, the adsorption capability of the substrate for organic small molecules like furfural was enhanced, and the size of silver nanoparticles was optimized to achieve better detection outcomes. The performance of the substrate was evaluated using R6G as the probe molecule, and the findings indicated that the substrate exhibited excellent sensitivity, uniformity (RSD values are below 10%), and antioxidant properties (after 30 days, the peak strength decreased by 8.23 %). When this substrate was utilized for the detection of transformer aging characteristics, the detection limits for furfural, acetone, and methanol reached 0.04 mg/L, 0.18 mg/L, and 0.18 mg/L respectively, fulfilling the analytical requirements of oil-immersed transformers. This research holds significant importance in guaranteeing the stable operation of the power supply system and the smooth development of the national economy.","[Yang, Dingkun] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yu] Wuwei Power Supply Co, State Grid Gansu Elect Power Co, Wuwei, Peoples R China; [Fan, Zhou] State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Consulting Engn Co, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Weigen; Wan, Fu] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Sec, Chongqing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications; State Grid Corporation of China; Chongqing University,"Yang, DK (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",yangdk@cqupt.edu.cn,"Yang, Dingkun/O-8290-2016","Yang, Dingkun/0000-0002-3717-8211",Project Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51977017],Project Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financially supported by the Project Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51977017) .,,27,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0026-265X,1095-9149,,MICROCHEM J,Microchem J.,DEC,2024,207,,,,,,,,112295,10.1016/j.microc.2024.112295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2024.112295,,NOV 2024,8,"Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,O5P4Z,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001371642300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, we provide evidence for the predictive value of US Nonfarm Payroll (USNP) in the out-of-sample forecast of gold market volatility. Second, we extend our analysis to other precious metals and the US stock market index for ro-bustness purposes. Third, we utilize mixed data frequencies based on the availability of data, thus, cir-cumventing any bias or information loss due to the use of monthly (low frequency) USNP data and daily (high frequency) gold price data. The results show that the USNP, which reflects gain/loss in US non-farm jobs, is negatively related to gold return volatility, implying that deterioration (improvement) in the economy due to job losses (gains) raises (lowers) the gold market volatility as its trading improves (dete-riorates) while the reverse is the case for US stocks. The out-of-sample predictive value of USNP in the return volatility of gold is also established as the model which includes the former offers better out-of -sample forecast gains than the benchmark model which ignores it. Additional analyses involving other precious metals, namely palladium, platinum, rhodium, and silver, show the same direction of relationship as gold, albeit with higher forecast gains for silver than the others. Our findings have useful implications for financial analysts and investors. (c) 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work aimed at evaluating the potential of discarded yerba mate (DYM) as a source of cellulose fibers suitable to retain low biodegradability emerging contaminants, such as dyes. In addition, we aimed at testing whether the inclusion of silver nanoparticles within those fibers could result in a novel nanocomposite with antimicrobial properties. The raw material (DYM) and the cellulose fibers were characterized according to TAPPI standards. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile strength assessment were conducted. The cellulose content of the DYM was 46.61%. The XRD analysis revealed an increase in cellulose crystallinity index from 19% in the raw material to 60% after cellulose extraction treatments. Cellulose fibers adsorbed about 80-90% of the dyes tested (crystal violet, CV; methylene blue, MB; and safranin, S) at a concentration of 20 mg/ L. The adsorption efficiency of the nanocomposite was somewhat lower than that of the fibers alone, while its ability to immobilize Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells was higher. Due to these features, the nanocomposite here described could be useful to obtain, in the future, a simple filtering device which could provide safer water at domestic level to periurban settlers with no access to potable water sources.","[Gordon-Falconi, Cintya; Iannone, Maria Florencia; Groppa, Maria Daniela] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Quim & Fisicoquim Biol IQUIFIB, Junin 956, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Zawoznik, Myriam Sara] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Catedra Quim Biol Vegetal, Junin 956, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Debut, Alexis] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Ctr Nanociencia & Nanotecnol, Av Gral Ruminahui s-n, Sangolqui, Ecuador; [Gordon-Falconi, Cintya] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Consejo Nacl lnvestigac Cient & Tecn, Inst Quim & Fisicoquim Biol IQUIFIB,Catedra Quim B, Junin 956, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito; University of Buenos Aires,"Gordon-Falconí, C (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Consejo Nacl lnvestigac Cient & Tecn, Inst Quim & Fisicoquim Biol IQUIFIB,Catedra Quim B, Junin 956, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, Argentina.",cgordon@ffyb.uba.ar,"Debut, Alexis/H-8424-2019",,University of Buenos Aires (UBACYT); Nanomaterials Characterization Laboratory of the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Center (CENCINAT) at the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas (ESPE); [20020170100149BA],University of Buenos Aires (UBACYT)(University of Buenos Aires); Nanomaterials Characterization Laboratory of the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Center (CENCINAT) at the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas (ESPE);,"This work was supported by the University of Buenos Aires (UBACYT 20020170100149BA) and the Nanomaterials Characterization Laboratory of the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Center (CENCINAT) at the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas (ESPE) , Ecuador.

In this work, we present how silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could be synthesized using Echinophora platyloba (E.P) plant extract as an environmentally friendly source, which acts as both reducing agent and capping agent for synthesis of small-sized AgNPs with maximum antibacterial and catalytic efficacy. The as-synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. The size of AgNPs were fine-tuned by adjusting the synthesis parameters such as pH of plant extract, temperature, and amount of AgNO3. It was found that pH is a determining factor, where the size of AgNPs could be tuned from 15 nm to 53 nm by decreasing the pH from 10 to 7. In addition, the kinetic of growth was found pH-dependent, where small-sized AgNPs grow faster than large ones, culminating in shortening reaction time at alkaline pH. Green syn-thesized AgNPs (15 nm) showed remarkable catalytic performance in degradation of different individual azo dyes (i.e., Congo red (CR), Rhodamine B (Rh), methyl red (MR), bromocresol blue (BCB), Imido Black (IB)) as well as their mixture. It was found that the 90.11 % of mixture of dyes were decomposed in 8 min, following a pseudo-first order kinetic model. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the as-synthesized AgNPs (15 nm) was obtained against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be 119.06 mu g/mL of silver nanoparticles for Escherichia coli (G-) and 59.53 mu g/mL for Staphylococcus aureus (G + ). The results of this work emphasize on how a cost-effective and green approach could be used for environmental application and affect circular economy by its potential future applications in medical and environmental fields.","[Rahmatian, Nasrin; Abbasi, Shahryar] Ilam Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Ilam, Iran; [Yaraki, Mohammad Tavakkoli] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Sch Nat Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Abbasi, Naser] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Biotechnol & Med Plants Res Ctr, Ilam, Iran",Ilam University; Macquarie University,"Abbasi, S (通讯作者)，Ilam Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Ilam, Iran.",sh_abbasi@ilam.ac.ir,"Yaraki, Mohammad/M-4254-2019","Tavakkoli Yaraki, Mohammad/0000-0002-6987-7885","Ilam University also Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam Uni-versity of Medical Sciences","Ilam University also Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam Uni-versity of Medical Sciences","The authors would like to thank the supports from Ilam University also Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam Uni-versity of Medical Sciences.

During thorough restoration that started in 2005, its wooden constructions became accessible for dendrochronological investigations. We collected representative samples from floor or ceiling constructions in most of the rooms in the castle. Dendrochronology helped us to identify felling dates of wood and to propose probable years of reconstructions in 1515, 1578, 1644, 1697, 1752, 1758, 1775 and 1878. The dating showed that the constructions in the presumed Romanesque and Renaissance parts of the building were not as old as expected, whereas those in the supposedly Baroque part of the castle were older than assumed. The selection of wood species used for constructions varied overtime. Constructions with end dates 1515-1697 were made of oak (Quercus petraea and Q. robur), those dated to 1752 of silver fir (Abies alba), those dated to 1758 of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and those dated to 1878 of common beech (Fagus sylvatica). Comparison of forestry archives and vegetation in the area showed that most of the timber could have originated from nearby forests; only silver fir had to be transported from sites that were at least 20 km away from the castle. Cross-dating of tree-ring series of oak elements with two reference chronologies from Slovenia and two from Austria confirmed the great likelihood that the wood used mostly originated from Slovenia. This indicates that dendroprovenancing, not used in the area before, could also be used SE of the Alps. Both the existing archival documents and dendrochronology indicate that woodworks have taken place every few decades in some periods. The dendrochronological dates can be partly linked to reports on earthquakes (especially the devastating one in 1511), rebellions and year marks carved on the stone plaques. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Hydrogen is the most common element on Earth. As a light substance, hydrogen can diffuse quickly; however, it also has a small risk of explosion. Representative explosion accidents have included the Muskingum River Power Plant Vapor Cloud Explosion accident in 2007 and the Silver Eagle Refinery Vapor Cloud Explosion accident in 2009. In addition, there was an explosion in a hydrogen tank in Gangneung, Korea, in May 2019, and a hydrogen refueling station (HRS) in Norway exploded in 2018. Despite this risk, Korea is promoting the establishment of HRSs in major urban centers, including downtown areas and public buildings, by using the Regulatory Sandbox to install HRSs. This paper employed the Hydrogen Risk Assessment Model (HyRAM) of Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) program specialized in hydrogen energy for HRSs installed in major urban hubs. A feasibility evaluation of the site conditions of an HRS was conducted using the French land use planning method based on the results obtained through evaluation using the HyRAM and the overpressure results of PHAST 8.0. After a risk assessment, we confirmed that an HRS would be considered safe, even if it was installed in the city center within a radius of influence of jet fires and overpressure.","[Kwak, Jongbeom; Lee, Haktae; Park, Somin; Park, Jaehyuk; Jung, Seungho] Ajou Univ, Dept Environm & Safety Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Ajou University,"Jung, S (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Dept Environm & Safety Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",processsafety@ajou.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2022R1F1A106546111],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2022R1F1A106546111).,,20,9,9,5,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY 8,2023,16,9,,,,,,,3963,10.3390/en16093963,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16093963,,,18,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,G1EH4,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000986668000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amount of durables and infrastructure or capital stock in the economy is of great interest in the literature of economics, and is usually measured in monetary terms based on the data on capital expenditure. In spite of its wide use by economists, this measure of capital stock is of very limited use for sustainable management of material stock because of its neglect of physical properties such as the mass and material composition. This paper proposes a new method of measuring the stock of long-lived durables and infrastructure in terms of the mass of its materials. This method is based on the WIO-MFA method [S. Nakamura et al. J. Ind. Ecol. 11 (2007) 50-63] and the capital formation matrix that is one of the supplementary tables of the input-output table. The method is applied to the Japanese input-output data with 400 sectors, with 9 types of metals (iron, ferroalloy, copper, zinc, lead, tin, aluminum, silver, and gold) and 8 types of plastics (thermo-setting resins, PE (low), PE (high), PS, PP, PVC, high-performance resins, and other resins) occurring as materials.

Consequently, a bibliometric analysis for the assessment of the current state of the art research, future trends as well as evolution through time of the critical metals research was performed in the present work. The study included four phases of work: (i) search string selection, (ii) data collection, (iii) data processing, and (iv) data interpretation. A total of 433 publications on critical metals were collected from Scopus database between 1977 and 2023, with an increasing yearly trend and a burst in 2013. The data retrieved showed a significant increase in publications related to the topic in the last 10 years. The results show that research interest is concentrated around six critical areas: (i) bioleaching as an important process of critical metal recovery, (ii) circular economy concepts and recovery of critical metals by urban mining from e-waste, (iii) resource recovery from waste landfills as urban mines, (iv) targeted studies on various critical elements (copper, zinc, gallium, silver, lithium), (v) rare elements as industry vitamins and, (vi) coal deposits and coal ashes as an alternative source of critical metals. This analysis could provide important guidance for further directions on the development of research for recovery of critical metals.","[Butu, Alina; Rodino, Steliana; Butu, Marian] Natl Inst Res & Dev Biol Sci, Biotechnol Dept, Bucharest 060031, Romania; [Rodino, Steliana] Inst Res Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Bucharest 011464, Romania",National Research Institute for Biological Sciences,"Rodino, S; Butu, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Res & Dev Biol Sci, Biotechnol Dept, Bucharest 060031, Romania.;Rodino, S (通讯作者)，Inst Res Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Bucharest 011464, Romania.",steliana.rodino@yahoo.com; marian_butu@yahoo.com,"Butu, Marian/B-6014-2017; RODINO, Steliana/AFL-3678-2022; BUTU, Alina/F-5950-2016","BUTU, Alina/0000-0001-8171-4352","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI [181/2020]","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number 181/2020 within PNCDI III.",,67,1,2,7,45,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2023,15,6,,,,,,,4834,10.3390/su15064834,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15064834,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,C2JF8,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000960235100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the actual development process, the phenomenon of promoting economic development at the cost of destroying the ecological environment still exists in all counties and townships. How to achieve both gold and silver mountains, but also lucid water and green mountains is the key issue of economic development. Taking Badong County in Hubei Province as an example, this paper studies the coupling development of economic development and ecological construction from 2017 to 2021 by constructing the economic development subsystem and the ecological environment subsystem. The results show that the coupling degree of economic development and ecological construction in Badong County is poor from 2017 to 2021, and the year with the highest coupling degree is 2018, which is only 0.4537, in a state of near imbalance; the year with the lowest coupling degree is 2021, only 0.2313, which is in a serious imbalance state. It shows that Badong County has serious ecological and environmental problems in the process of pursuing economic development. It needs to pay attention to ecological and environmental protection, and take measures such as vigorously developing tourism, improving the production technology level of enterprises, and deepening the education of environmental protection awareness, to promote the coordinated development of economy and ecology.","[Tian, Shenrui] Sichuan Univ, Sch Int Studies, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhaoping] Zhejiang Guangsha Vocat & Tech Univ Construct, Sch Management Engn, Jinhua 322103, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Sichuan University,"Tian, ZP (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Guangsha Vocat & Tech Univ Construct, Sch Management Engn, Jinhua 322103, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tianzhaoping@zjgsdx.edu.cn,,,,,"Acknowledgements The phased achievement of the general project of the National Social Science Foundation of China, Research on the long-term mechanism to solve the relative poverty in ethnic areas (Project No.: 20BMZ140)",,23,0,0,5,10,GH ASACHI TECHNICAL UNIV IASI,IASI,"71 MANGERON BLVD, IASI, 700050, ROMANIA",1582-9596,1843-3707,,ENVIRON ENG MANAG J,Environ.

This study was conducted to explore the potential to establish an integrated sociotechnical framework with the end goal to assess whether or not ENMs and nano-enabled products contribute VAB. Based on the research in this study, it is suggested that all stakeholders in the larger society-environment-economy (SEE) system should develop an understanding of the multiple interrelationships within and between the diverse constituents along the particle lifecycle trajectory to capture their influence on the system benefit and risk outcomes. Furthermore, the sociotechnical framework establishes an additional three-step process: (1) at the pre-design stage, the test of VAB should be assessed using an expert panel representing the different segments of SEE, the social principles of design are detailed and customized to the needs of ENMs and nano-enabled products, and an economic appraisal is conducted to justify the VAB on material grounds; (2) at the design stage, the technical principles should be examined and detailed to ensure the compatibility of stakeholder needs; and (3) an iterative adaptive cycle should be conducted to re-examine the sociotechnical principles on a periodic basis. Within this context, ENMs are considered sustainable when (a) the conditions of VAB and minimal risk elements are satisfied in a sequential order, with VAB demonstrated at the pre-design stage, then at the design stage ENMs posing no harm greater than minimal levels to the SEE constituents; and (b) ENMs and nano-enabled products are bounded by a finite time limit. In addition, to reach the conditions of sustainability, the role of all SEE stakeholders should be broadened (e.g., regulatory agencies should transform their roles from not only the control of risks of negative implications, but also the establishment of positive implications as well).","[Tolaymat, Thabet] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Abdelraheem, Wael; El Badawy, Amro; Genaidy, Ash] Worldtek Inc, Cincinnati, OH 45249 USA; [Abdelraheem, Wael] Sohag Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Sohag 82524, Egypt; [Dionysiou, Dionysios] Univ Cincinnati, Sustainable Solut Lab, Dept Biomed Chem & Environm Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Sohag University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Tolaymat, T (通讯作者)，US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",tolaymat.thabet@epa.gov,"Abdelraheem, Wael/N-9023-2013","Abdelraheem, Wael/0000-0001-7895-4849; Abdelraheem, Wael/0000-0003-4390-7756; El Badawy, Amro/0000-0002-0060-8716; Dionysiou, Dionysios/0000-0002-6974-9197",,,,,46,4,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-954X,1618-9558,,CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR,Clean Technol.

However, most industrial parks are still being planned, built, and managed with little concern for resource efficiency and social and environmental impacts. In response, eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are currently being considered in many developing and transition economies. The absence of a replicable deployment method and a normative standard for EIPs, or even of a widely accepted definition, results in difficulties in finding a flexible, but robust management scheme and related indicators adapted to such complex industrial systems. This paper aims to address EIP implementation and monitoring by providing a new approach to EIP development in Vietnam as part of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization's cleaner production program. It fills a gap in research about how to engage in EIPs at a national level when know-how and general resource efficiency level are low. The methodology proposed establishes a bottom-up participative process adapted to transition and developing economies to foster EIP emergence and define minimum requirements, related indicators, and a continuous improvement method. A two-day expert group meeting took place in Vietnam in September 2016. A participative approach was applied over three work sessions. This national consultation resulted in a joint definition and vision of EIPs in Vietnam, including the social, environmental, and governance challenges to be addressed. It also produced a three-tiered standardization scheme: bronze, silver, and gold. Each tier defines minimum requirements, criteria, and indicators to monitor results and recognize an EIP as such. Lastly, legislation and policy reinforcement to support the standard deployment and control mechanisms has been outlined. The results (the overall methodology and the standardization scheme) can be applied to other countries by international organizations or national governments to build EIP capacities. From a scientific perspective, results from similar experiences in other developing countries will make it possible to compare outcomes and variability in criteria and indicators so EIPs can be recognized as such.

Thus, the public funds for older residents' wellbeing are at risk of being cut back under the economic austerity due to the prevalent neoliberalism policy atmosphere. However, some cities set good examples to turn their older citizens into active contributors to sustainable urban development (SUD) by developing age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC). Taking Hong Kong as an example, this study aims to raise a strategy for policymakers, especially at the municipal level, to incorporate the concept of AFCC in SUD. Data were retrieved for our analysis from a published report of the Hong Kong Public Policy Research Fund project. A total of 15 AFCC and SUD policy factors were identified by using factor analysis. The correlations between these policy factors were evaluated and visualised in a synergetic effect network. According to the network, this study indicates that developing the silver hair market can be a suitable entry point to realise SUD by adopting an AFCC development. Isolation prevention, social sustainability and low-energy-consumption development are the supportive policy factors for the silver hair market. Specifically, respect, discrimination prevention, communication and information, age-friendly facilities, environmental safety and public transportation accessibility are five AFCC policy factors incorporated in the policy integration to enhance older residents' wellbeing further. This study is an innovative attempt to develop a comprehensive model for the synergy between sustainable urban development and an age-friendly city and community using a correlation network. This study also provides a reference for other city governments to respond to population ageing positively.","[Han, Jianbo; Chan, Edwin Hon Wan; Yung, Esther Hiu Kwan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Qian, Queena Kun] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, NL-2628 Delft, Netherlands",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Delft University of Technology,"Han, J (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg & Real Estate, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",blacksunset1116@hotmail.com; edwin.chan@polyu.edu.hk; k.Qian@tudelft.nl; esther.yung@polyu.edu.hk,"Yung, Esther/ABF-3279-2020; Chan, Edwin Hon Wan/D-9630-2012","Chan, Edwin Hon Wan/0000-0003-4841-6956; Han, Jianbo/0000-0002-8769-3860",,,,,166,15,15,12,79,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8614,10.3390/su13158614,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158614,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TW3XP,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000682337600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper describes some technological advances in the recovery processes for copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc. It does not discuss pyrometallurgy. Korea, like many nations with industrial economies, consumes large amounts of these metals, and is dependent on overseas suppliers for nearly its entire supply. This paper also discusses how technology for recovery of metal now in Korea, for example from existing wastes, is important. Improved reagents for both leaching and froth flotation of copper minerals, plus bio-oxidation and pressure autoclaving for gold have improved metal recovery. Copper recovery by SX-EW is expanding rapidly, and the method is also commercial for zinc. Biooxidation of encapsulating waste materials and, in some instances, of the desired metal has reached commercial scale. Pressure leaching on a large scale solves specific problems for several metals. Improvements in gold and silver cyanidation include variants of activated carbon adsorption from solution. Zinc and lead still largely depend on flotation for the treatment of ores. However, innovation in hydrometallurgical extraction has been spurred by environmental concerns. Computer modeling and process control worldwide have likely led to the largest improvements in recovery. The limited availability of land, clean water and sites for waste disposal in many countries affects the economics of re-treatment of existing wastes. Some of the new technologies could be combined, for example in modular plants that can be moved between reclamation sites to economic advantage on the Korean Peninsula.","James Geoassociates, Lakewood, CO 80215 USA",,"James, LP (通讯作者)，James Geoassociates, Lakewood, CO 80215 USA.",,,,,,,,24,2,2,1,18,KOREAN INST CHEM ENGINEERS,SEOUL,"#307 REGENT RIVER VIEW OFFICE, 547-8 KUI-DONG SUNGDONG-KU, SEOUL 133-200, SOUTH KOREA",0256-1115,,,KOREAN J CHEM ENG,Korean J.

It synthesizes the work of scholars who have collected and published data on individual cities and periods, and presents comparable indices of real wages and prices in the colonial period that give a reasonable guide to trends in the long run. We show that nominal wages and prices were on average much higher than in Western Europe or in Asia, a reflection of the low value of silver that must have had consequences for competitiveness of the Latin American economies. Labour scarcity was the second salient feature of Spanish Latin America and resulted in real wages much above subsistence and in some cases (Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina) comparable to levels in Northwestern Europe. For Mexico, this was caused by the dramatic decline of the population after the Conquest. For Bolivia, the driving force was the boom in silver mining in Potosi that created a huge demand for labour. In the case of Argentina, low population density was a pre-colonial feature. Perhaps due to a different pattern of depopulation, the real wages of other regions (Peru, Colombia and Chile) were much lower, and only increased above subsistence during the first half of the 18th century. These results are consistent with independent evidence on biological standards of living and with estimates of GDP per capita at the beginning of the 19th century. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The NPs exhibited average sizes of 3.07 f 2.38 nm (Ag), 70.42 f 18 nm (ZnO), and 104.38 f 11.7 nm (SiO2) with high colloidal stability (Z potentials:-35.63 mV for Ag,-33.9 mV for ZnO, and-10 mV for SiO2). Bioplastics functionalized with these NPs showed improved properties: increased rigidity (Young's modulus up to 2690 MPa in B-SiO2), reduced water absorption (160.64 g/100 g dry matter in B-Ag), high transparency (87.87 % in BControl, 87.83 % in B-ZnO), and lower wettability (contact angle of 102.4 degrees in B-ZnO). Thermal stability also improved, with B-SiO2 exhibiting the lowest mass loss (31.12 %) in TGA. Bioplastics with Ag demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity, maintaining low mold and yeast counts (<10 CFU/g). Biodegradation was faster in soil than in marine environments, with NPs modulating rates. As primary and secondary packaging for blueberries, Ag-functionalized bioplastics reduced mass loss and preserved firmness for up to 56 days at 4.3 degrees C, with no NP migration detected by XRF and FTIR.

In addition, the pandemic is shaking up traditional workplace structures and causing employers to rethink how essential tasks can be done, which may broaden their views of workplace accommodations. We assess the potential for the pandemic to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Methods This article analyzes pre-COVID data on disability and home-based work from three representative data sources-the American Community Survey, American Time Use Survey, and Current Population Survey. We employ both cross-tabulations and regressions to predict work at home. Results We find that workers with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities both to work primarily from home and to do any work at home. This is true for both employees and self-employed workers. Workers with disabilities face similar wage gaps in on-site and home-based work, indicating that while increased availability of home-based work may create more employment opportunities for workers with disabilities, it is unlikely to erase wage disparities. While workers with disabilities are currently more likely to be working primarily from home, only 34% are in occupations with high potential for home-based work, compared to 40% of workers without disabilities. Conclusions Workers with disabilities are currently more likely to work from home and many may benefit from expanded work-at-home opportunities, but the types of jobs they hold constrain this potential. Research is needed to see how home-based work evolves as the economy recovers from the pandemic over the next several years.","[Schur, Lisa A.; Kruse, Douglas] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Management & Labor Relat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Ameri, Mason] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Kruse, D (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Sch Management & Labor Relat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",lschur@smlr.rutgers.edu; Mason.ameri@rutgers.edu; dkruse@smlr.rutgers.edu,"Schur, Lisa/AAH-1855-2020; Ameri, Mason/AHD-3668-2022; Kruse, Douglas/S-6103-2019","Kruse, Douglas/0000-0002-7121-7616; Ameri, Mason/0000-0003-4181-0811",,,,,47,131,151,3,42,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1053-0487,1573-3688,,J OCCUP REHABIL,J.

Current therapeutic approaches are multifaceted and focus on improving wound healing and preventing recurrences. Advanced wound dressings, especially super absorbent dressings are an important aspect of wound care, as hard-to-heal wounds tend to produce excessive amounts of exudate, which may contribute to maceration and excoriation, thus delaying wound healing. Additionally, excessive wound exudate is associated with malodour. Therefore, an important aspect of care is the management of exudate and odour. The use of effective advanced wound dressings is a promising strategy to achieve adequate absorption of wound exudate and malodour promoting wound healing. The aim of the current study is to determine whether there is a difference in wound size reduction between wounds dressed with either a sterile polyacrylate wound dressing with activated carbon cloth or a hydrocellular foam dressing with silver. Method: A randomised controlled trial with 248 participants in one wound care outpatient clinic is proposed. Randomisation will be concealed. The outcome assessor will be blinded to the group allocation of participants. Conclusion: This research project compares two wound dressings in an everyday care setting. Since the cost of hard-to-heal wounds to individuals, the economy and society is high, an evaluation of which wound dressing leads to a faster reduction of wound size and subsequent wound healing is an important issue/question for the individuals affected, their families, society and the health-care system.","[Probst, Sebastian; Saini, Camille] HES SO Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland, Geneva Sch Hlth Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Skinner, Monika Buehrer] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; University of Zurich,"Probst, S (通讯作者)，HES SO Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland, Geneva Sch Hlth Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",sebastian.probst@hesge.ch,"Probst, Sebastian/AAN-6968-2020","Probst, Sebastian/0000-0001-9603-1570","Curea Medical GmbH, Steinfurt, Germany","Curea Medical GmbH, Steinfurt, Germany","The authors have no conflict of interest.

For years, achievements of nanotechnology have been applied mainly in biomedicine and computer science, but recently it has also been used in the food industry. Due to the extremely small (nano) scale, the properties and behavior of nanomaterials may differ from their macroscopic counterparts. They can be used as biosensors to detect reagents or microorganisms, monitor bacterial growth conditions, increase food durability e.g. when placed in food packaging, reducing the amount of certain ingredients without changing the consistency of the product (research on fat substitutes is underway), improve the taste of food, make some nutrients get better absorbed by the body, etc. There are companies on the market that are already introducing nanoparticles into the economy to improve their functionality, e.g. baby feeding bottles. This review focuses on the use of nanoparticles in the food industry, both organic (chitosan, cellulose, proteins) and inorganic (silver, iron, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, etc.). The use of nanomaterials in food production requires compliance with all legal requirements regarding the safety and quantity of nano-processed food products described in this review. In the future, new methods of testing nanoparticles should be developed that would ensure the effectiveness of compounds subjected to, for example, nano-encapsulation, i.e. whether the encapsulation process had a positive impact on the specific properties of these compounds. Nanotechnology has revolutionized our approach towards food engineering (from production to processing), food storage and the creation of new materials and products, and the search for new product applications.","[Wasilewska, A.; Bielicka, M.; Klekotka, U.; Kalska-Szostko, B.] Univ Bialystok, Fac Chem, Str Ciolkowskiego 1K, PL-15245 Bialystok, Poland; [Wasilewska, A.; Bielicka, M.] Univ Bialystok, Doctoral Sch Exact & Nat Sci, Str Ciolkowskiego 1K, PL-15245 Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok; University of Bialystok,"Kalska-Szostko, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Chem, Str Ciolkowskiego 1K, PL-15245 Bialystok, Poland.",kalska@uwb.edu.pl,"Wasilewska, Anna/HKE-5885-2023; Klekotka, Urszula/HMP-5264-2023","Bielicka, Magda/0000-0002-3263-6826",,,,,177,24,24,9,105,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2042-6496,2042-650X,,FOOD FUNCT,Food Funct.,MAR 20,2023,14,6,,,,,2544,2567,,10.1039/d2fo02180c,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2fo02180c,,FEB 2023,25,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Food Science & Technology,C9BR9,36799219,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000937488100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With massive amounts of solar panel waste coming to end-of-life, it is imperative to recover all the Ag from these modules. In this paper, we propose a novel method to easily reclaim Ag from end-of-life silicon solar cells using low concentration sulfuric acid (H2SO4) leaching followed by ultrasonication. Our process simplifies the Ag recycling procedure by directly recovering the Ag contacts from solar cells, eliminating the need for secondary precipitation/electrodeposition. First, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the leaching and ultrasonication process on rejected solar wafers. Next, a solar panel from landfill was heated in a furnace to burn off the polymer encapsulant. The silicon wafers were then collected from the burning process and leached in 2 M H2SO4 at two different shaking speeds for 48 h at room temperature. Finally, the end-of-life silicon wafer pieces were collected, sonicated in water, and then the sonication water was centrifuged to show a proof-of-concept to recover the Ag contacts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES) is used to monitor dissolved elements in the leachate as a function of time and shaking speed. XPS is used to evaluate the composition of the silicon cell wafer surface before and after H2SO4 leaching. SEM is used to image the recovered Ag contacts morphology and EDX confirms the recovered particles contain high amounts of Ag. A proposed schematic illustrates the authors' hypothesis for the peeling mechanism.","[Click, Natalie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Teknetzi, Ioanna; Ebin, Burcak] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Nucl Chem & Ind Mat Recycling, Kemivagen 4, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tam, Eric Pui Lam] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Ind & Mat Sci, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Tao, Meng] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Chalmers University of Technology; Chalmers University of Technology; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ebin, B (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Nucl Chem & Ind Mat Recycling, Kemivagen 4, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",burcak@chalmers.se,"Ebin, Burçak/ABC-8689-2020","Tao, Meng/0000-0001-5743-7092; Click, Natalie/0000-0003-3189-9250; Tam, Pui Lam/0000-0001-7367-9382; Ebin, Burcak/0000-0002-0737-0835; Teknetzi, Ioanna/0000-0001-9365-0317",Swedish Energy Agency [P2019-90193]; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under the Advanced Manufacturing Office [DE-EE0007897],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under the Advanced Manufacturing Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency [project no: P2019-90193] .

Herein, we have developed a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor by integrating gold-silver alloy nanocoral clusters (Au-Ag-ANCCs) with reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) and poly(L-histidine) composites at the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The developed sensor (Au-Ag-ANCCs/r-GO/poly(L-histidine)/GCE) was designed for the simultaneous determination of vancomycin (VAN) and ceftriaxone (CFT) residues in food samples. Its morphological and electrochemical properties were exhaustively examined using UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDX, EIS, and CV. The sensor showed exceptional performance in a linear range of 1.0 pM to 120 mu M for VAN and 1.0 pM to 290 mu M for CFT. The limits of detection were 0.11 pM for VAN and 0.017 pM for CFT, while the limits of quantification were 0.36 pM for VAN and 0.057 pM for CFT. The sensor exhibited remarkable reproducibility, repeatability, stability, and selectivity. It was successfully applied to detect VAN and CFT residues in chicken meat, fish, and milk, achieving recoveries of 96.2-102.1 % with relative standard deviation (RSD) below 5 %. Therefore, the sensor is an ideal tool for addressing the global antibiotic residue crisis in food samples.","[Adane, Wondimeneh Dubale; Chandravanshi, Bhagwan Singh; Chebude, Yonas; Tessema, Merid] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Chandravanshi, BS; Tessema, M (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",bscv2006@yahoo.com; tessemamerid@yahoo.com,"Chandravanshi, Bhagwan/AAD-1546-2022",,,,"The authors express their gratitude to the Department of Chemistry at Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for generously of-fering the laboratory resources.",,50,8,8,25,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",1385-8947,1873-3212,,CHEM ENG J,Chem.

To address this, a robust recycling strategy is essential to recover valuable metal resources from end-of-life PVs, promoting resource reuse, circular economy principles, and mitigating environmental impact. Recovery efforts primarily target metallic resources such as silicon, silver, copper, lead, and tin from first-generation PVs, along with critical elements including tellurium, indium, selenium, and gallium from second-generation PVs. This study advocates for research and development initiatives aimed at reducing recycling costs and environmental footprint compared to disposal methods while maximizing material retrieval. Particularly, the focus lies on the advantageous recovery of high-value silicon over intact silicon wafers. Through investigation, this research demonstrates the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of silicon wafer recovery from damaged silicon solar panels.

J,"Edvinsson, R",,,,"Edvinsson, Rodney",,,The international political economy of early modern copper mercantilism: Rent seeking and copper money in Sweden 1624-1776,EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Money; Copper; Mercantilism; Monopoly; Bimetallism; Sweden,,"In 1624-1776 Sweden minted intrinsic value copper coins, alongside silver coins. One purpose behind introducing the copper standard was to use its monopoly position at the European markets to manipulate the international copper prices, implementing a kind of copper mercantilism. This paper presents a model of an early modern copper monopolist that could price discriminate between two different uses for copper: copper for export and copper for minting. The paper concludes that authorities did not completely conform to this rent-seeking model, since there were also other considerations behind minting policy, such as providing a stable monetary system. The model shows that under profit-maximisation minting should have been even higher and the price of copper money lower, but at periods minting and prices approached the optimal state. In the 17th century, the market for copper money was probably too small relative the huge copper production, but by the 17205 and 1730s, when copper production had declined, the copper standard functioned more smoothly.

The main methods for nanoparticle production are chemical and physical approaches that are often costly and potentially harmful to the environ-ment. The present review is devoted to the possibility of metal nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts. This approach has been actively pursued in recent years as an alternative, efficient, inexpensive, and environmentally safe method for producing nanoparticles with specified properties. This review provides a detailed analysis of the various factors affecting the morphology, size, and yield of metal nanoparticles. The main focus is on the role of the natural plant biomolecules involved in the bioreduction of metal salts during the nanoparticle synthesis. Examples of effective use of exogenous biomatrices (peptides, proteins, and viral particles) to obtain nanoparti-cles in plant extracts are discussed.","[Makarov, V. V.; Kalinina, N.

Many studies have focused extensively on the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into various useful chemicals. However, there is not yet a solution of sufficiently high enough efficiency and stability to demonstrate practical applicability. In this work, we use first-principles-based high-throughput screening to propose silver-based catalysts for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO while decreasing the overpotential by 0.4-0.5 V. We discovered the covalency-aided electrochemical reaction (CAER) mechanism in which p-block dopants have a major effect on the modulating reaction energetics by imposing partial covalency into the metal catalysts, thereby enhancing their catalytic activity well beyond modulations arising from d-block dopants. In particular, sulfur or arsenic doping can effectively minimize the overpotential with good structural and electrochemical stability. We expect this work to provide useful insights to guide the development of a feasible strategy to overcome the limitations of current technology for electrochemical CO2 conversion.","[Lim, Hyung-Kyu; Shin, Hyeyoung; Kim, Hyungjun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy Environm Water & Sustainabil EEWS, Taejon 305701, South Korea; [Goddard, William A., III] CALTECH, Mat & Proc Simulat Ctr, Beckman Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hwang, Yun Jeong; Min, Byoung Koun] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Clean Energy Res Ctr, Seoul 136791, South Korea; [Min, Byoung Koun] Korea Univ, Green Sch, Seoul 136713, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); California Institute of Technology; Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); Korea University,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Energy Environm Water & Sustainabil EEWS, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",linus16@kaist.ac.kr,"Lim, Hyung-Kyu/V-3110-2019; Kim, Hyungjun/B-4527-2013; Goddard, William/AEF-2933-2022","Hwang, Yun Jeong/0000-0002-0980-1758; Lim, Hyung-Kyu/0000-0002-2403-2766","Global Frontier RAMP;D Program on Center for Hybrid Interface Materials (HIM) - Ministry of Science, ICT AMP; Future Planning [2013M3A6B1078884]; Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)","Global Frontier RAMP;D Program on Center for Hybrid Interface Materials (HIM) - Ministry of Science, ICT AMP; Future Planning; Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST))","This work was supported by the Global Frontier R&D Program (2013M3A6B1078884) on Center for Hybrid Interface Materials (HIM) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, and by the institutional program of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).

Baby boomers, those born in the years after the Second World War, or more typically between 1946 and 1964, are the specific focus of this research interest. This paper estimates the determinants of travel expenditures in baby boomer senior households in Taiwan. The traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) approach, combined with quantile regression analysis, is adopted to capture both the mean and quantile behaviours of travel expenditures in baby boomer households, using the 2008 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) in Taiwan. The OLS model is used to obtain the average (mean) expenditure behaviour, whereas quantile regression analysis captures the extreme behaviours of the two tails of travel expenditures in baby boomer households. The estimation outcomes have important policy implications for travel marketers and operators in the tourism industry who seek to understand baby boomer senior consumers.","[Kuo, Hsiao-I] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Golden Ager Ind Management, Taichung 41349, Taiwan; [Lu, Ching-Lung] Taipei Chengshih Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Taipei, Taiwan",Chaoyang University of Technology,"Kuo, HI (通讯作者)，Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Golden Ager Ind Management, Taichung 41349, Taiwan.",hikuo@cyut.edu.tw; casperlu5476@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,24,27,2,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Plant breeding should not be regarded as a silver bullet, but its contribution to global food security can be substantial. Given the continued growth of the world population and an increasing scarcity of natural resources, the important role of plant breeding in increasing production is widely acknowledged. Less appreciated is the fact OF that plant breeding can also be instrumental in easing the distribution problem. The majority of the undernourished people worldwide lives in rural areas, where they directly or indirectly depend on small-scale farming. Suitable new crop varieties - both conventional and genetically modified ones - can increase small farm incomes, alleviate poverty, and stimulate economy.-wide growth. Furthermore, biofortified crop varieties can reduce micronutrient deficiencies which are particularly widespread among women and children. These positive impacts notwithstanding, public investments into breeding research programs are being increasingly scaled down. This trend should be stopped and reversed. In addition, the private sector, too, should put a stronger emphasis on the interests of developing countries in specific fields of its breeding research.","Univ Hohenheim, Lehrstuhl Int Agrarhandel & Welternahrungswirtsch, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Qaim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Lehrstuhl Int Agrarhandel & Welternahrungswirtsch, 490B, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",qaim@uni-hohenheim.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",,,,,26,2,2,0,11,"W KOHLHAMMER GMBH, I A JOCHEN KRAUSS",STUTTGART,"AMTGERICHT STUTTGART HRB 1733HRB, STUTTGART, 00000, GERMANY",0005-9080,,,BER LANDWIRTSCH,Ber.

In 2050, cumulative PV waste is estimated at 2,000,000-3,000,000 tonnes for slow, conservative, and realistic forecast installations, though under ambitious installs, waste will be 1-2 times more. Additionally, in 5 years PV EoL silver and aluminium could supply on average 30 % of future PV demand, 50 % in 15 years, and even up to 100 % in 25 years, considering realistic or ambitious forecast installations. These findings seek to assist in establishing sustainable EoL PV management, including the planning of logistics, appropriate recycling methods, consumer-appropriate policy, and the integration of circularity.","[Tan, Verity; Deng, Rong; Egan, Renate] Univ New South Wales, Sch Photovolta & Renewable Energy Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Deng, R (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Photovolta & Renewable Energy Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",rong.deng@unsw.edu.au,"Tan, Verity/GXG-1930-2022","Tan, Verity/0009-0009-0463-5111; Egan, Renate/0000-0002-8970-4703; Deng, Rong/0000-0002-1452-8020",School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering; Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP); Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA); NEOEN,School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering; Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP); Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)(Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)); NEOEN,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) , Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and NEOEN in this work.

In this approach, the percolation threshold of conductive filler is reduced by a multiple percolation of the matrix phase. Laminate strength is retained in the 0/90 degrees fiber orientation and only slightly reduced in the +/-45 degrees orientation. Shielding effectiveness in excess of 60 dB is obtained at a microsphere volume fraction of only 19%.

This essay offers an account of the way vertebrate fossils were priced in late 19th-century America to explore the process by which monetary values are established in science. Examining a long and drawn-out negotiation over the sale of an unusually rich dinosaur quarry in Wyoming, I argue that, on their own, abstract market principles did not suffice to mediate between supply and demand. Rather, people haggling over the price of dinosaur bones looked to social norms from the mineral industry for cues on how to value these rare and unusual objects, adopting a set of negotiation tactics that exploited asymmetries in the distribution of scarce information to secure the better end of the deal. On the mining frontier in America's Gilded Age, dinosaurs were thus valued in much the same way as any other scarce natural resource one could dig out of the ground, including gold, silver, and coal.","Brown Univ, Dept Hist, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Rieppel, L (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Hist, Box N,79 Brown St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",lukas_rieppel@brown.edu,,,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant,National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This study was supported by a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant.,,97,15,18,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0306-3127,1460-3659,,SOC STUD SCI,Soc.

The trace metals (Ag, Ni, Co, and Sn) in all phases and their distribution coefficients were calculated as a function of matte grade. Results show that silver and nickel can be effectively recovered into matte, whereas cobalt and tin are predominantly deported into slag and gas phases, respectively. These results augment the fundamental ther-modynamic data of trace metal distributions in copper smelting processes at low-silica fluxing practices.","[Chen, Min; Avarmaa, Katri; Taskinen, Pekka; Klemettinen, Lassi; Jokilaakso, Ari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Kemistintie 1F,POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Michallik, Radoslaw; O'Brien, Hugh] Geol Survey Finland, Vuorimiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Jokilaakso, Ari] POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Avarmaa, Katri] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Mech & Prod Design Engn, John Str, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia",Aalto University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK); Swinburne University of Technology,"Jokilaakso, A (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Kemistintie 1F,POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.;Jokilaakso, A (通讯作者)，POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",min.chen@aalto.fi; kavarmaa@swin.edu.au; pekka.taskinen@aalto.fi; lassi.klemettinen@aalto.fi; radoslaw.michallik@gtk.fi; hugh.obrien@gtk.fi; ari.jokilaakso@aalto.fi,"Chen, Min/ABD-3375-2021; Taskinen, Pekka/K-4292-2015; Klemettinen, Lassi/AAA-4936-2020; Jokilaakso, Ari/AAP-6978-2020","Jokilaakso, Ari/0000-0003-0582-7181; Klemettinen, Lassi/0000-0001-9633-7131; Chen, Min/0000-0003-0544-4359","Aalto University, School of Chemical Engineering; China Scholarship Council [201806370217]","Aalto University, School of Chemical Engineering; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This study was partly financially supported by Aalto University, School of Chemical Engineering.

Previous research on digital innovation in firms has often neglected the impact of macroeconomic cycles. This paper examines the moderating effect of the economic slowcession in the digital transformation and corporate innovation nexus, by using the China's A-share listed companies'data during 2001 and 2021. The empirical results find that the positive impact of digitization on innovation is countercyclical. During recession, the positive impact of digital transformation on innovation is even greater compared to economic prosperity. Grouped regression results indicate that State-owned listed companies, Non-high tech companies, Large-scale companies, and Eastern companies are more affected by the positive moderating effect of the recession. This indicates that getting out of recession requires more aggressive support of these companies, which promotes innovation and economic recovery. This study provides a useful reference for countries in recession and provides an important complement to traditional economic cycle theory and innovation cycle theory.","[Du, Zhuo-Ya] Jilin Univ, Sch Econ, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian] Jilin Univ, Publ Sect Res Ctr KRI, Sch Econ, Jilin 130012, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Publ Sect Res Ctr KRI, Sch Econ, Jilin 130012, Peoples R China.",wangqian@jlu.edu.cn,"DU, Zhuoya/LHA-3751-2024",,Quality on Corporate Financing Constraints from the Perspective of Digital transformation [2023CX012]; China Scholarship Council [202306170119],Quality on Corporate Financing Constraints from the Perspective of Digital transformation; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),Research on Confidential Computing and Data Governance of China Financial Technolo-gy (2021XWK03) ; Research on the Road of Chinese Open Cooperation and High Quality Economic Development (2022CXTD04) ; Research on the Impact of Information Disclosure Quality on Corporate Financing Constraints from the Perspective of Digital transformation (2023CX012) .

However, we know little about these crowdworkers' perspective on MTCS and its implications for their personal life. Building on insights from three qualitative surveys with responses from 538 crowdworkers and 576 forum posts in total, we show that despite the often challenging work conditions, MTCS platforms provide these crowdworkers with a work environment in which they can participate in paid work activities without feeling excluded due to their personal circumstances. As a result, MTCS platform work provides these crowdworkers with a set of positive experiences that were not possible before. These afforded experiences go beyond work-related experiences but relate directly to crowdworkers' personal situation and life. Our research yields implications for the literature on MTCS and also for policy makers and stakeholders concerned with the creation of more inclusive work settings.","[Mayer, Anne-Sophie] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, KIN Ctr Digital Innovat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ihl, Andreas] Danube Univ Krems, Dept Management & Econ, Krems, Austria; [Grabl, Susanne; Strunk, Kim; Fiedler, Marina] Univ Passau, Management People & Informat, Passau, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Danube University Krems; University of Passau,"Mayer, AS (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, KIN Ctr Digital Innovat, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.s.mayer@vu.nl,,"Mayer, Anne-Sophie/0000-0002-2777-7157; Strunk, Kim Simon/0000-0002-2896-814X",,,,,82,3,3,8,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-1917,1365-2575,,INFORM SYST J,Inf.

It is necessary to see how trade relations between them have played out within the WTO from a historical perspective. Since the Opium Wars, both economic and political concerns have changed the relationship between these two countries. The escalation from a trade conflict to trade war shows the rivalry between the US and China for hegemony in the twenty-first century's regional and world politics. The economic, technological, and manufacturing competition that is a part of hegemonic rivalry is not totally new; this is borne out by the history of the US-China economic relations. The escalation of this 'trade war' now has spill-over effects on other countries, being beyond the normative framework of the WTO. There is an impasse in this ongoing saga, but the silver lining is that there will be a iv-construction of the multilateral trading system.","[Hur, Nany] Korea Univ, Sch Law, Seoul, South Korea; [Hur, Nany] Lee & Ko Global Commerce Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Hur, N (通讯作者)，17th Floor,Hanjin Bldg 63 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 04532, South Korea.",nanyhur@hanmail.net,"Hur, Nany/A-3469-2019",,,,,,61,10,14,6,92,YIJUN INST INT LAW,SEOUL,"562 GWANGNARURO, KWANGJIN-GU, NO 201 KYUNGWOO BD, SEOUL, 05033, SOUTH KOREA",1976-9229,,,J E ASIA INT LAW,J.

This article reports several findings and hypotheses derived from a set of least likely cases, the Gilded Age presidents. These executives are often dismissed as weak and ineffective non-entities. However, statistical data and qualitative evidence suggest that presidents do matter, even during the Gilded Age. They are powerful and essential actors who can deeply affect American economic performance in three subtle ways. The (in)action of Gilded Age presidents during economic crises appears to have mattered most. More tentatively, presidential vision and skill at coalition building also appear to correlate strongly with economic performance. These findings are not merely of historical interest, as the similarities with the twenty-first century are striking. These cases therefore have important implications for theories of presidential power and performance, American political development, and the role of ideas in politics.","[Zachary Taylor, Mark] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Taylor, MZ (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",mzak@gatech.edu,,,,,,,100,0,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0360-4918,1741-5705,,PRES STUD Q,Pres.

Nano-enhanced feed has been shown to improve fish growth rates, while nanomaterials are reducing the treatment economy by effectively eliminating contaminants. Genetic manipulation methods combined with nanobiotechnology have revolutionized fish ancestry studies, with advancements such as nanosensors and DNA-based vaccines significantly impacting fish life and immune systems. Moreover, nanotechnology plays a crucial role in enhancing fish processing, enabling sterile packaging and precise flavoring. Utilizing fishery waste through bio-nano-engineering and green nanoparticles offers new post-harvesting practices.

We then use it to make predictions about the quality of a country's public officials and to understand the role of institutions granting politicians with immunity from legal prosecution. The use of punishment lowers the returns from public office and reduces the incentives of high-ability citizens to enter public life. Cheaper plomo and more resources subject to official discretion are associated with more frequent corruption and less able politicians. This predicts that violence in a country will typically go together with corruption and worse politicians. Moreover, the possibility of punishment. changes the nature of the influence game, so that even cheaper plata can lower the ability of public officials. Protecting officials from accusations of corruption (immunity) will decrease the frequency of corruption if the judiciary is weak and may increase the quality of politicians. These predictions cannot emerge from a traditional model where only bribes are used.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94701 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Travers Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94701 USA; Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Brown University; Harvard University,"Dal Bó, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94701 USA.",,,,,,,,46,140,171,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0003-0554,,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

However, there are limitations, such as precise size and morphological control, due to a lack of knowledge about the mechanically induced processes of NP formation under milling. In this article, we further investigate the BUMS of AuNPs. Using SiO2 as a solid support, we studied the effect of typical reducing agents, namely NaBH4, l-ascorbic acid, and hydroquinone (HQ), on the conversion of a AuIII source. XANES showed that HQ is the strongest reducing agent under our experimental conditions, leading to the quantitative conversion of gold salt in a few minutes. Interestingly, even when HQ was used in sub-stoichiometric amounts, AuIII could be reduced to ratios higher than 85% after two minutes of milling. Investigations into the byproducts by 1H NMR and GC-FID/MS enabled the identification HQ regeneration and the formation of its derivatives. We mainly focused on benzoquinone (BQ), which is the product of the oxidation of HQ as it reduces the gold salt. We could demonstrate that HQ is regenerated from BQ exclusively under milling and acidic conditions. The regenerated HQ and other HQ-chlorinated molecules could then reduce gold-oxidized species, leading to higher conversions and economy of reactants. Our study highlights the intriguing and complex mechanisms of mechanochemical systems, in addition to fostering the atom and energy economy side of mechanochemical means to produce metal nanoparticles. The hydroquinone reducing agent is regenerated during the mechanochemical reduction of gold salt to form metal nanoparticles, and it remains active in the chemical reduction process even when used in sub-stoichiometric conditions.","[Xavier, Ismael P.

We argue that rather than focusing singularly on transitioning a 'protein gap' in diets, redressing the 'justice gap' is a prerequisite for transformative change in food systems. In this context the justice gap is understood as the gap delineating those who have access to just food systems and those who do not. To substantiate our argument a justice lens is used to analyse the political-economic dimensions of such a transformation and to propose that the future of protein must engage with three core elements to be transformative-disruption, innovation and redistribution. Disruption entails challenging both the food trends that encourage the 'meatification' of diets, and the influence of 'Big Meat' in perpetuating these trends. Innovation emphasises that true novelty is found by designing justice into practices and processes, rather than by firing alternative protein silver bullets within existing food system paradigms. Redistribution stresses that food system redesign is predicated upon establishing fair shares for remaining protein budgets, using approaches anchored in contextual specificity and positionality. Through the application of a justice framework, we expose existing food system injustices related to production and consumption of protein, invite discussion on how such injustices can be addressed and reflect on implications for food system transformations. By reshaping the crux of the protein debate around the more salient concern of the justice gap, food system transformation can take shape.","[Baudish, Isabel; Sahlin, Kajsa Resare; Pereira, Laura] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Baudish, Isabel] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bene, Christophe] CIAT, Cali, Colombia; [Bene, Christophe] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Econ Res Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Oosterveer, Peter; Prins, Heleen] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pereira, Laura] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa",Stockholm University; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; University of Witwatersrand,"Baudish, I (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.;Baudish, I (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Stockholm, Sweden.",isabel.baudish@gmail.com,"Bene, Chris/ACK-2643-2022; Pereira, Laura/L-7258-2013",,Svenska Forskningsrdet Formashttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862; Case of the Netherlands,Svenska Forskningsrdet Formashttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862; Case of the Netherlands,"This article used the work of L B, C B, P O and H P in the unpublished report Protein Transitions Beyond the Political Economy: the Case of the Netherlands as a starting point.

Based on interprovincial panel data in 2000-2018, this paper measured the ratio of five survival and enjoyment consumptions in disposable incomes, reconstructed the indicators for upgrading the consumption structure, used the bilateral stochastic cutting-edge model, and decomposed the aging population to realize the net effect from the positive and negative effects generated by the consumption structure. The findings indicated that (1) aging population played a positive and negative bilateral effect on upgrading the consumption structure, in which the positive effect upgraded 14.04% of the consumption structure while the negative effect degraded 6.18% of the consumption structure. The comprehensive net effect upgraded 7.86% of the consumption structure. (2) From the perspective of the time effect, under the positive and negative effects of aging population, the consumption structure was upgraded 7.861% on average every year. (3) Regarding the regional effect, the promotion role of aging population was the highest in the eastern region, followed by the west. The middle was the lowest. By combining with estimation results of each province, the promotion role brought by aging population in the northeast and southwest was lower.

In this study, we were particularly interested to determine whether or not metallic ENPs have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects upon plant performance. An emphasis was made to analyze the scientific evidence on investigations examining both types of effects in the same studies. Analysis of evidence demonstrated that metallic ENPs have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects mostly in well-controlled environments and soilless media. Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) and Cu ENPs have potential for use as micronutrients for plant systems, keeping in mind the proper formulation at the right dose for each type of ENP. The concentration levels for the stimulatory effects of Cu ENPs are lower than for those for nZVI. Newer findings showed that extremely smaller concentrations of Au ENPs (smaller than those for nZVI and Cu ENPs) induce positive effects for plant growth, which is attributed to effects on secondary metabolites. Ag ENPs have demonstrated their usage as antimicrobial/pesticidal agents for plant protection; however, precautions should be taken to avoid higher concentrations not only for plant systems, but also, other constituents in the SEE. Further research is warranted to investigate the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of metallic ENPs in soil media in order to broaden the horizon of sustainable agriculture production in terms of higher and safer yields so as to meet the food requirements of human population.

Floral wastes (FWs) clog the water channel and release pesticides, harming human beings and resident aquatic biota if left in landfills. Due to a lack of water bodies, flowers are left in landfills, which release methane, increase carbon emissions, and pollute the air and soil. Flowers are widely used for religious rituals, ceremonies, expressions of respect, and industrial use in perfumes, cosmetics, and textiles all over the world. Although the demand for flowers in India has been increasing day by day due to a steady rise in the population and the number of temples and mosques across the nation, the management of FWs is widely overlooked, leading to serious environmental and health hazards. Flowers contain essential phytochemicals such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and other useful substances. The purpose of this review is to examine what has been learned about the management of floral wastes and how values can be added to them while reducing their improper disposal. To achieve the objective of zero-waste in rivers, lakes, and landfills, floral wastes are to be recycled optimally. This paper provides a critical review highlighting the current state of floral waste in India, followed by existing effective floral waste management strategies from the perspective of the circular economy. We recommend rapid recycling and optimal management of FWs by extracting bioactive substances, prospecting their wide applications, and adding value to them.","[Gupta, Vishal Kumar; Kumar, Ram] Cent Univ South Bihar, Sch Earth Biol & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Ecosyst Res Lab, SH-7,Gaya Panchanpur Rd, Gaya 824326, Bihar, India; [Dhanker, Raunak] GD Goenka Univ, Sch Engn & Sci, Dept Basic & Appl Sci, Gurugram, Haryana, India; [Kamble, Shashank S.] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Biotechnol, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Kamble, Shashank S.] Amity Univ, Ctr Drug Discovery & Dev, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Mohamed, Heba I.] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Educ, Biol & Geol Sci Dept, Cairo 11341, Egypt",Central University of South Bihar; GD Goenka University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University,"Kumar, R (通讯作者)，Cent Univ South Bihar, Sch Earth Biol & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Ecosyst Res Lab, SH-7,Gaya Panchanpur Rd, Gaya 824326, Bihar, India.;Mohamed, HI (通讯作者)，Ain Shams Univ, Fac Educ, Biol & Geol Sci Dept, Cairo 11341, Egypt.",ramkumar@cub.ac.in; hebaibrahim79@gmail.com,"mohamed, heba/U-8673-2019; Dhanker, Raunak/JCE-5114-2023; Kamble, Shashank/GLV-0233-2022; GUPTA, VISHAL/JXN-1095-2024","Mohamed, Heba/0000-0002-6892-3376; KUMAR, RAM/0000-0002-4637-6973; Dhanker, Raunak/0000-0002-0299-9933; Kamble, Shashank/0000-0002-2291-1599",,,,,152,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0049-6979,1573-2932,,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,JUN,2024,235,6,,,,,,,436,10.1007/s11270-024-07228-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07228-9,,,32,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,UP0Z3,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001249155700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Domestically consumed mineral raw materials have been assigned to groups corresponding to the main way of their usage, distinguishing: fuels, metallic, ceramic, chemical, construction, and others. Complementary to the presented demand- supply relations are trade balances of selected commodities. Analysis of available statistical data showed that the demand for substantial number of mineral raw materials in Poland has been met by imports and this probably will be continued in future. The reasons for Poland's sustained import dependency of mineral raw materials is the lack or insufficient reserve base, as well as low quality of raw materials available from deposits occurring in the country. The exceptions are construction raw materials and some ceramic ones, as well minerals exported in significant qualities (e.g.: refined copper, silver, zinc, sulphur, lead raw materials, or selenium), for which it can be stated that their domestic supplies may fully satisfy the demand of the national economy. On the other hand, the scale of utilization of such fuels as hard coal and lignite, which represent very significant item in Poland's total energy mix, may be greatly reduced in the light of EU directives aimed at restricted use of these fossil fuels. The possible alternative is development of the use of renewable energy sources, while in the case of metals - improved recycling of scrap and metal-bearing wastes.","[Lewicka, Ewa; Burkowicz, Anna] Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Krakow, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences; Mineral & Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Lewicka, E (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Krakow, Poland.",lewicka@min-pan.krakow.pl; burkowicz@min-pan.krakow.pl,"Lewicka, Ewa/K-3474-2018","Lewicka, Ewa/0000-0002-6286-3886",,,,,9,6,6,0,13,"POLSKA AKAD NAUK, POLISH ACAD SCIENCES, MINER & ENERGY ECON RES INST PAS",WARSZAWA,"PL DEFILAD 1, WARSZAWA, 00-901, POLAND",0860-0953,2299-2324,,GOSPOD SUROWCAMI MIN,Gospod.

This waste might posture a significant threat to human health or the environmental matrices (water, air, soil) when inadequately treated, transported, stored, or managed/disposed of. Therefore, effective waste management in an economically viable and environmentally friendly way has become meaningful. Prominent technology is the need of the day for circular economy and sustainable development to reduce the speed of depletion in resources and produce an alternative means for the future demands in the different sectors of science and technology. In order to meet the potential requirements for energy production or producing secondary raw material, solid waste may be the prime source. The activities of living organisms convert waste products in one form or another in which electronic waste (e-waste) is a modern-day problem that is growing by leaps and bounds. The disposal protocols of the e-waste management need to be given proper attention to avoid its hazardous impacts. The e-waste is obtained from any equipment or devices that run by electricity or batteries like laptops, palmtops, computers, televisions, mobile phones, digital video discs (DVD), and many more. E-waste is one of the rapidly growing causes of world pollution today. Plenty of research is available in the scientific literature, which shows different approaches being set up and followed to manage and dispose of waste products. These strategies to manage waste products designed by the states all over the globe revolves around minimal production, authentic techniques for the management of waste produced, reuse and recycling, etc. The virtual survey of the available literature on waste management shows that it lacks specificity regarding the management of waste products parallel to ecological sustainability. The presented review covers the sources, potential environmental impacts, and highlights the importance of waste management strategies to provide the latest and updated knowledge. The review also put forward the countermeasures that need to be taken on national and International levels addressing the sensitive issue of waste management. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The dam failure was amongst the largest recorded, and led to widespread debate in the province concerning weak environmental law and the effects of deregulation. This paper examines the changing role of the law in British Columbia around mining and the environment in relationship to the Mount Polley disaster. It draws on the work of the early Soviet legal theorist Evigny Pashukanis to help understand law's role in the commodification of nature. Pashukanis suggests a legal analysis of the commodity form and a study of laws role in commodification. However, contemporary law departs from the rigid and formal property and contract principles that Pashukanis considered, and now responsible to shifting social conditions, technologies and environmental concern. Yet even today, Pashukanis remains relevant, and provides a starting point for analysis of how nature is commodified. His work points to a study of the multiplicities of, and variegated legal geographies of, commodity forms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

E-waste production has surged, increasing by similar to 2 million metric tonnes (Mt) annually, reaching 60 Mt in 2023, with projections suggesting it will exceed 70 Mt by 2030. Despite China, the United States, and India being the top E-waste producers, their recycling rates remain critically low at 16%, 15%, and 1%, respectively. E-waste contains valuable metals, such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu), which comprise similar to 60% of its composition. However, only 17.4% of the global E-waste was appropriately recycled in 2023. This Review discusses the latest data on E-waste, evaluates current metal recovery methods, and emphasizes the urgency of sustainable solutions to mitigate environmental hazards and promote a circular economy. The paper also covers case studies highlighting challenges and potential strategies for enhancing metal recovery efficiency, contributing significantly to global sustainability efforts and waste management.","[Jadoun, Sapana] Univ Tarapaca?, Fac Ciencias, Dept Qui?m, Sol ARIS, Arica 1000000, Chile; [Chinnam, Sampath] M S Ramaiah Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Bengaluru 560054, Karnataka, India; [Jabin, Shagufta] Manav Rachna Int Inst Res & Studies, Sch Engn & Technol, Faridabad 121004, Haryana, India; [Upadhyay, Yachana] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol MNIT, Dept Chem, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Jangid, Nirmala Kumari] Banasthali Vidyapith, Dept Chem, Banasthali 304022, Rajasthan, India; [Zia, Jannatun] Siddhartha Acad Higher Educ Deemed Univ, Dept Chem, Vijayawada 572107, AP, India",Universidad de Tarapaca; Ramaiah Institute of Technology; Manav Rachna International Institute of Research & Studies; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur; Banasthali Vidyapith,"Jadoun, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tarapaca?, Fac Ciencias, Dept Qui?m, Sol ARIS, Arica 1000000, Chile.",sjadoun@academicos.uta.cl,"Jadoun, Sapana/K-7638-2019; Zia, Jannatun/MXJ-9289-2025; Chinnam, Sampath/AAX-5327-2020; Jangid, Nirmala/GXF-6974-2022; UPADHYAY, YACHANA/HTR-3370-2023; Jabin, Shagufta/AAH-7842-2020","Jangid, Dr. Nirmala Kumari/0000-0002-3594-7742","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient?fico y Tecnol?gico [FONDECYT 3200850, ANID/FONDAP/1523A0006]; National Research and Development Agency of Chile; Solar Energy Research Center (SERC), Chile","Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient?fico y Tecnol?gico; National Research and Development Agency of Chile; Solar Energy Research Center (SERC), Chile","S.

In particular, isocyanide-based cyclization has proven to be versatile for producing N-containing heterocycles among these cyclization processes. Until now, two typical modes of isocyanide-based cyclizations have been established, including the use of isocyanides as C1 synthons and C1N1 synthons. As we know, a series of reviews has documented advances in the use of isocyanides as C1 synthons. However, a critical and specific review with deep insights into isocyanide C1N1 chemistry remains unexplored. Therefore, we would like to summarize recent advances in the use of isocyanides as C1N1 synthons. To the best of our knowledge, a series of dual-functionalized isocyanides, such as 2-arylphenylisocyanides and 2-alkynylphenylisocyanides, has been efficiently realised by a model of radical chemistry, and these advances are not included in this manuscript since many elegant reviews have been published.

Findings reveal the evidence of asymmetric spillovers among the assets across time and different frequency cycles. While the spillover is stronger for commodities within the same class, gold and silver have the strongest connectedness with green bonds regardless of the periods. However, crude oil observes a strong connection with green bonds in the long-run. Additionally, the asymmetric spillover results show that positive returns spillover is stronger in the short-run, while negative returns spillover substantially holds in both periods but is more pronounced in the short-run. In all, this study unveils the importance of the green bonds market in serving as succor against risk in other commodity markets (except precious metals) at different time horizons. Also, under appropriate scaling up of the green bond market with viable environmental policies, it promises to attract more investors so that it continues to fulfill its goal of ensuring a green economy.","[Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr] Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Grad Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland; [Adekoya, Oluwasegun B.; Oliyide, Johnson A.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Abeokuta, Nigeria","University College Dublin; University of Agriculture, Abeokuta","Naeem, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Smurfit Grad Sch Business, Dublin, Ireland.",muhammad.naeem@ucd.ie,"Oliyide, Johnson/AAD-2654-2021; Adekoya, Oluwasegun/ABA-2556-2020; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/HCH-3576-2022","Adekoya, Oluwasegun/0000-0001-7238-6932; Naeem, Muhammad Abubakr/0000-0001-6962-3175; Oliyide, Johnson/0000-0001-7415-8730",Science Foundation Ireland [16/SPP/3347],Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)),Muhammad Abubakr Naeem gratefully acknowledges the support of Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 16/SPP/3347.,,42,123,124,4,86,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

However, recent research has raised concern about side effects of this mode of operation. It is becoming increasingly evident that PPPs have a crucial role in the privatization and economization of the education sector on a national level and in the context of the emerging global education industry (GEI). This article collects and analyzes the characteristics of GEI with reference to the research context of expanding public-private networks in the field of German public education. It further explores how private actors came into a prominent position in public education by laying out a set of economically shaped knowledge politics and network strategies that prompted a dynamization of the field of education including education policy. Remarkably enough, core aspects of GEI highly resonate on a national scale.

Through the comparison of the statistical properties of different samples of hacksilver and balance weights from various contexts of the Near Eastern Bronze Age, the study attempts to assess whether the weight values of bullion-currencies can be expected to comply with existing weight-standards. The results of the statistical analyses on a silver hoard from Ebla (Syria) strongly suggest that hacksilver in the Bronze Age Near East was shaped and/or fragmented in order to comply with the weight-systems that were in use in the trade networks where it circulated. The results also show the possibility to quantify the level of affinity between different weight-systems. The study is intended to provide a starting point for future research, aimed at the identification of different forms of bullion-currencies in pre- and protohistoric economies. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Knowledge of host-parasite relationships is important to understanding the role of parasites in the control of natural host populations. This work describes histopathological aspects caused by several common intestinal parasites found during a helminthological survey of fish in northern Brazil. We observed a high prevalence of helminth infection, especially by J3 nematode juveniles of the family Anisakidae and metacestodes of the family Protocephalidae (both with 100% prevalence). An external capsule surrounded each juvenile with numerous juveniles inside sac-like structures formed of connective tissue. Inflammation was observed to be caused by infection of metacestodes, reaching the intestinal muscularis mucosa. Neoechinorhynchus veropesoi (38% prevalence) was found in the small intestine of P. squamosissimus, invading the mucosa, submucosa, and internal muscularis of the intestine causing intense inflammation. Histopathology of host-parasite relationships in fish has been rare, and the pathology of parasites in P. squamosissimus is described herein.","[de Vasconcelos Melo, Francisco Tiago] Minist Educ Brazil, CAPES Fdn, BR-70004002 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Vasconcelos Melo, Francisco Tiago; Giese, Elane Guerreiro; dos Santos, Jeannie Nascimento] Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Biol Celular & Helmintol Profa Dra Reinalda M, BR-66075110 Belem, PA, Brazil; [Ribeiro Rodrigues, Rogerio Antonio; Giese, Elane Guerreiro] Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Inst Saude & Prod Anim, Lab Histol & Embriol Anim, BR-66077901 Belem, PA, Brazil; [Gardner, Scott Lyell] Univ Nebraska, State Museum, Harold W Manter Lab Parasitol, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Gardner, Scott Lyell] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Universidade Federal do Para; Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA); University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Melo, FTD (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Biol Celular & Helmintol Profa Dra Reinalda M, Rua Augusto Correa 01, BR-66075110 Belem, PA, Brazil.",ftiago@ufpa.br,"Gardner, Scott/HTN-1969-2023; NASCIMENTO DOS SANTOS, JEANNIE/F-7130-2012; Melo, Francisco Tiago Vasconcelos/I-2974-2015","NASCIMENTO DOS SANTOS, JEANNIE/0000-0002-6612-6410; Melo, Francisco Tiago Vasconcelos/0000-0001-8935-2923","CAPES Foundation; Ministry of Education of Brazil [9489/12-2]; Pro-Reitoria de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Tecnologico (PROPED) from Federal Rural University of Amazon; Harold W.

The swelling of the polymer, determined by an on-line coupling between high pressure cell and an optical method using digital camera, under 60-200 bar at 60, 75 and 90 degrees C, was well reproduced by a modified Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state. The diffusion coefficient of CO2 into EVA-28 was determined using the same approach and was found to range, at 130 bar, from 1.1 x 10(-9) m(2).s(-1) at 60 degrees C to 1.8 x 10(-9) m(2).s(-1) at 90 degrees C.

This paper explores the cross-border environmental impacts of the RoHS by focusing on the shifts to lead-free solders in Japan, which exports many electronics to the EU. The regulatory impacts are quantified by integrating a material flow analysis for metals constituting a solder with a scenario analysis with and without the RoHS. The results indicate that the EU regulation, the RoHS, has triggered shifts in Japan to lead-free solders, not only for electronics subject to this regulation, but for other products as well. We also find that the RoHS leads to a slow reduction in environmental emissions of the target, lead, but results in a rapid increase in the use of tin and silver in lead-free solders. This indicates the importance of assessing potential alternative substances, the use of which may increase as a result of adhering to the RoHS. The latter constitutes a negative impact because of recent concerns regarding resource criticality.","[Fuse, Masaaki; Tsunemi, Kiyotaka] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST),"Fuse, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, 16-1 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan.",m-fuse@aist.go.jp,"Fuse, Masaaki/J-9012-2015; Tsunemi, Kiyotaka/M-2610-2018","Tsunemi, Kiyotaka/0000-0002-7114-3645",,,,,26,6,7,0,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

It is therefore not surprising that organizations consider these professionals a strategic resource that enhances their competitiveness. This phenomenon has engendered employers' preoccupation with topics such as motivation or career management of engineers (Igbaria, Kassicieh and Silver, 1999). The fact that Schein's career anchor model (1978) allows a better understanding of this new management challenge explains researchers' growing interest in the concept of career anchors. Schein's career anchor model (1978) is considered a major contribution to the understanding of individual career paths. A total of eight anchors have been defined: (1) functional/technical competence, (2) managerial competence, (3) autonomy/independence, (4) security/stability, (5) entrepreneurial creativity, (6) sense of service, (7) pure challenge and (8) lifestyle. This theory rests on the implicit postulate that an individual has only one dominant anchor. This phenomenon of dominance is known as differentiation. Moreover, numerous researchers extrapolate from Schein that only the career anchor with the highest score should be retained to operationalize the concept of dominance or differentiation.

This work provides a case study of the role of ports in tourism development It presents an analysis of air and maritime transport used by tourists to visit the Island of Porto Santo, Madeira Islands, Portugal. The climate changes and strong winds during the year can reduce tourist demand for the inter-island sea travel in the Madeira Archipelago. Porto Santo is a strategic transfer point for tourism, and improving the shipping infrastructures will enable a faster and more diversified maritime transportation system. To capitalise on these developments, Porto Santo needs to improve its reputation as an exclusive beach destination.

For realizing economies of scales for themselves, and improving the information security and bringing efficiencies for their clients, the SPs implement machine-learning-based automation (MLA) for ITO service delivery on SDPs. However, MLA is not a silver bullet and exposes the outsourced scopes to new types of information security risks (ISRs). This paper aims at exploring those ISRs and understanding their implications. It applies agency theory to examine differing viewpoints of multiple organizations engaged in an ITO relationship. The study investigates an ITO setup of three organizations in the telecom industry. To gain insights into ISR implications, a qualitative approach was followed using a case study method and data was collected through interviews. Adversarial attack scenarios, ISRs and ISR implications on ITO service delivery are presented.

Here, we report a strategy in which we modify the surface of bimetallic silver-copper catalyst with aromatic heterocycles such as thiadiazole and triazole derivatives to increase the conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbon molecules. By combining operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy with electrocatalytic measurements and analysis of the reaction products, we identified that the electron withdrawing nature of functional groups orients the reaction pathway towards the production of C2+ species (ethanol and ethylene) and enhances the reaction rate on the surface of the catalyst by adjusting the electronic state of surface copper atoms. As a result, we achieve a high Faradaic efficiency for the C2+ formation of approximate to 80% and full-cell energy efficiency of 20.3% with a specific current density of 261.4 mA cm(-2) for C2+ products. Strategies to systematically tune CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products are of high interests.

The glazed window system, which is the weakest part in the building envelopes, remarkably contributes to energy loss. Scholars and manufacturers are constantly working to improve the thermal properties of glass, such as Low-E glass, aerogel glass, vacuum glass, and so on. However, the advanced glazing either shades the sunlight in winter, or is too expensive to be widely used. In this paper, polycarbonate films with high transparency are used as the interval layers of double glazing, which not only have better thermal properties and visible light transmittance in winter, but also are less expensive to be used. The structures and thermal properties of multiple thermal insulating glazing with polycarbonate films (MTIGP) are systematically investigated. The U-values of MTIGP can be achieved from 1.5 to 2.0 W/m(2)center dot K with high transmittance of visible light (T-vis, 60-70%), when compared with a typical Low-E double glazing system (U-value, around 2.0 W/m(2)center dot K; TVis, around 60%), even lower when argon (Ar) or krypton (Kr) is used instead of air. The Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) of MTIGP is higher than that of a typical Low-E double glazing system, which means more sunlight transmitting into the glazing system in winter to keep the rooms warmer. MTIGP and double silver Low-E pane are simulated with EnergyPlus, the results shows that energy consumption of MTIGP is better than that of double silver Low-E pane. The developed glazing system is expected to be used in severe cold and cold climate zones to improve thermal insulation and sunlight transmittance to reduce energy consumption.","[Li, Ning; Wang, Pin; Lu, Sumei] Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Meng, Qinglin; Zhao, Lihua; Li, Hao; Wang, Junsong] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Nan] GZ Municipal Grp Design Inst Co Ltd, Guangzhou 510060, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning] Dongguan Univ Technol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Intelligent Disaster Preven, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China",Dongguan University of Technology; South China University of Technology; Dongguan University of Technology,"Li, N (通讯作者)，Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China.",arlining@dgut.edu.cn,"Wang, Junsong/GNH-4461-2022; Zhang, Nan/JRX-2448-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [2020A1515111115]; Regional Joint Fund of Basic amp; Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province of China [2020507140142]; Key Social Science Projects in Dongguan of China [GC300501-123]; DGUT Dr Foundation; [51508198,51608205]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Regional Joint Fund of Basic amp; Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province of China; Key Social Science Projects in Dongguan of China; DGUT Dr Foundation;,"Acknowledgements This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 51508198,51608205) ; Regional Joint Fund of Basic & Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province of China (grant number 2020A1515111115) , Key Social Science Projects in Dongguan of China (grant number 2020507140142) , and DGUT Dr Foundation (grant number GC300501-123) .",,28,7,7,11,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

In particular, no enantioselective synthe-sis of such frameworks possessing a configurationally stable stereo -genic C-N axis with step-or pot-economy has been disclosed. Here-in, we report a practical synthesis of atropisomeric eight-membered lactam-bridged N-arylindoles through a conceptually intriguing stepwise cut-and-sew strategy. The key to success lies in the devel-opment of a silver-catalyzed atroposelective ring-opening/cycliza-tion cascade reaction of N-arylindole lactams with isocyanoacetates to establish C-N axial chirality. This method features operational simplicity, good functional group tolerance, high efficiency, as well as good to high enantiocontrol.

Age-friendly smart urban environments, supported by telecare services with embedded ambient intelligence, will be an essential part of how ageing societies will maintain and improve the quality of life of the growing number of residents with declining functional abilities and reduce the public financing of the long-term care services - reducing the needed number of caregivers. A review of relevant literature has shown that telecare supported by smart environments is an under-researched topic and that a central gap includes the lack of research on the integration of telecare services into the healthcare and long-term care systems.

This study extracted data on oil, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, aluminium, and nickel prices and constructed a digitalization index to draw its linkages with multifactor green productivity (green growth). It applies the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR) and reveals that energy prices and precious metals influence green growth negatively; however, these effects are substantially varied at different levels of green growth. In contrast, digitization supports green transformation in the BRICS region. Implementing digital innovation in industries and establishing sustainable securities play a crucial role in explaining the green growth of emerging nations. The study's results also underscored the significance of fluctuations in mineral and energy metal prices in influencing green growth, with oil prices playing a pivotal role in shaping the business cycles of these nations.","[Zhou, Qiyun; Wu, Jianpeng] Foshan Polytech, Econ Management Coll, Foshan 528137, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoming] South China Normal Univ, Int Business Coll, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China",South China Normal University,"Zhou, QY (通讯作者)，Foshan Polytech, Econ Management Coll, Foshan 528137, Peoples R China.",ztpterry2014@sina.com; audon@fspt.edu.cn; xmzuo@ibc.scnu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Qiyun/HPF-5854-2023",,National Social Science Foundation of China [20BJY103],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was sponsored in part by National Social Science Foundation of China (20BJY103) .,,62,1,1,4,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

It explains bacterial and fungal bioleaching techniques that extract copper, gold, zinc, and other metals from solid matrices. Fungal bioleaching effectively extracts a wide range of valuable metals, including nickel, vanadium, aluminium, molybdenum, cobalt, iron, manganese, silver, platinum, and palladium. The review highlights different solid matrices with metal contents that have the potential to be recovered by bioleaching, presenting promising bioprocess alternatives to current industrially available technologies for metal recovery. The optimal conditions for bioleaching, including pH, temperature, agitation-aeration, and pulp density are also discussed. The review shows that bioleaching has the potential to play a crucial role in the transition to a more sustainable and circular economy by providing an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly method for metal recovery from solid matrices.","[Rendon-Castrillon, Leidy; Ramirez-Carmona, Margarita; Ocampo-Lopez, Carlos] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Chem Engn Fac, Ctr Estudios & Invest Biotecnol CIBIOT, Medellin 050031, Colombia; [Gomez-Arroyave, Luis] Bioexplora SAS, Medellin 050031, Colombia",Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana,"Ocampo-López, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Chem Engn Fac, Ctr Estudios & Invest Biotecnol CIBIOT, Medellin 050031, Colombia.",leidy.rendon@upb.edu.co; margarita.ramirez@upb.edu.co; carlos.ocampo@upb.edu.co; geologobioexplora@gmail.com,"Ocampo-Lopez, Carlos/IQU-0846-2023","Ocampo-Lopez, Carlos/0000-0002-5541-6439; Rendon Castrillon, Leidy Johanna/0000-0002-0326-5587; Ramirez Carmona, Margarita Enid/0000-0001-9361-6522",,,,,158,11,11,15,57,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2023,15,13,,,,,,,10222,10.3390/su151310222,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151310222,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,M2JR9,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001028501400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ownership of mines meant that mineral wealth, discovered or undiscovered, belonged to the crown estate. Only the sovereign could grant mining rights to 'private' persons and impose mineral taxation. Particularly during the last three centuries of the Reconquista (thirteenth to fifteenth centuries), these principles were used to unify the situation in those territories falling under the sway of a sovereign with expansionist ambitions. Increasing globalisation of the metal trade in the thirteenth century and the formation of capital markets in Europe firmly put the Castilian crown in competition with other economic agents aiming to win a monopoly in metallic wealth. Castile's mining laws aspired to solve the ensuing tension by attracting merchant capital to the mines, aiming to absorb the comparative advantages of mining capital. In a protracted process, the mineral laws of the sixteenth century were a testimony to the decisive influence of the sovereign in the history of mining.","CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10468 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY),"Graulau, J (通讯作者)，CUNY Herbert H Lehman Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bronx, NY 10468 USA.",,,,,,,,164,7,8,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0268-4160,,,CONTINUITY CHANGE,Continuity Change,MAY,2011,26,,1,,,,13,44,,10.1017/S0268416011000051,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0268416011000051,,,32,History,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History,757PR,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000290100700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many examples on the multicomponent difunctionalization of alkenes under metal-catalyzed or metal-free conditions have extentively been reported. Among them, the asymmetric version of some reactions was successfully achieved by the use of chiral ligands. However, compared with nobel metal catalysts such as ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, palladium and silver, the cheaper metal catalysts including iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese have attracted more special attention. In view of the application of copper catalyst and organoboron reagents in organic synthesis, the advances in copper-catalyzed multicomponent difunctionalization of alkenes with organoboron reagents since 2018 are reviewed.

Therefore, a highly sensitive and selective method is required for their detection in water samples. Herein, advanced ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor platform was developed by integrating gold -silver alloy nanocoral clusters (Au - Ag- ANCCs) with functionalized multi -walled carbon nanotube-carbon paste electrode ( f -MWCNT-CPE) and choline chloride (ChCl) nanocomposites for simultaneously determining the residues of antimicrobial drugs, rifampicin (RAMP) and norfloxacin (NFX), in water samples. Results: The developed sensor (Au - Ag-ANCCs/ f -MWCNTs-CPE/ChCl) was extensively characterized using several analytical (UV - Vis, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and EDX) and electrochemical (EIS, CV, and SWV) techniques. It exhibited outstanding performance in a wide linear range, from 14 pM to 115 mu M for RAMP, and from 0.9 nM to 200 mu M for NFX, with a limit of detection (LOD, 3 sigma/m, S/N = 3, n = 5) and a limit of quantification (LOQ, 10 sigma/m, S/N = 3, n = 5) values of 2.7 pM and 8.85 pM for RAMP, and 0.14 nM and 0.47 nM for NFX, respectively. The sensor also exhibited exceptional reproducibility, stability, and resistance to interference. Significance: The developed sensor was effectively utilized to determine RAMP and NFX residues in hospital wastewater, river, and tap water samples, yielding recoveries within the range of 96.8 - 103 % and relative standard deviations below 5 %. Generally, the proposed sensor demonstrated remarkable performance in detecting the target analytes, making it an ideal tool and the first of its kind for addressing global antibiotic residue pollutants in water sources.","[Adane, Wondimeneh Dubale; Chandravanshi, Bhagwan Singh; Getachew, Negash; Tessema, Merid] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Chandravanshi, BS; Tessema, M (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",bscv2006@yahoo.com; tessemamerid@yahoo.com,"Chandravanshi, Bhagwan/AAD-1546-2022","Chandravanshi, Bhagwan/0000-0003-3240-1629",,,,,42,11,11,3,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0003-2670,1873-4324,,ANAL CHIM ACTA,Anal.

Politicians, analysts, and global experts see 'clean' hydrogen as the ultimate solution for addressing the climate crisis. This optimism is shared by several major oil and gas-exporting nations, which are investing heavily in hydrogen infrastructure to establish themselves as future global hubs. Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are especially well-positioned, benefiting from strategic advantages over other hydrogen-producing regions in the Global South. Advocates in these countries view hydrogen as a potential 'silver bullet' for sustaining political and economic influence in a world increasingly shaped by climate constraints. Western technology and expertise play a significant role in supporting these efforts. By using various qualitative methods, this paper employs and expand the concept of technopolitics to evaluate the role of industrialized nations in endorsing the Gulf states' authoritarian, top-down, techno-optimistic approach to their sustainability agenda.","[Zumbraegel, Tobias] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Zumbraegel, T (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",tobias.zumbraegel@uni-heidelberg.de,"Zumbraegel, Tobias/MTF-7593-2025","Zumbragel, Tobias/0000-0002-2895-9948",,,,,153,1,1,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,JAN,2025,158,,,,,,,,104168,10.1016/j.geoforum.2024.104168,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2024.104168,,NOV 2024,11,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,O0B6Q,,hybrid,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001367885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They often have a climate sceptic approach and do away with mitigation policies when coming to power. Increasing impacts of extreme meteorological events linked to climate change could lead to a situation where the supporters of the populist leader or elites crucial for the survival of an authoritarian regime are pushing to do something to address climate change. In order not to lose power, the leader may look for quick and cheap solutions. In such a context, solar radiation modification (SRM), for example, by stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), will become very attractive as it is likely to have low costs and rapid effects. Populist or authoritarian governments are unlikely to care for negative impacts of SRM abroad as they often act nationalistically with an explicit disdain for multilateral solutions. We discuss the incentive structure and political economy that populist and authoritarian leaders may face regarding unilateral use of SRM and elaborate how the international community could try to prevent or at least 'contain' such unilateral uses of SRM. Unfortunately, such 'containment' is contingent on the most powerful states not being populist or authoritarian regimes.","[Michaelowa, Axel] Perspect Climate Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Michaelowa, Axel] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Michaelowa, A (通讯作者)，Perspect Climate Res, Zurich, Switzerland.;Michaelowa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Michaelowa, Axel/0000-0001-5053-3700",,,,,81,6,6,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1758-5880,1758-5899,,GLOB POLICY,Glob.

In this assessment, we look at how to maximize the lake's benefits through product diversification, value addition, and sustainable use of its fisheries. We show that minimizing post-harvest losses of the silver cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea), locally known as Dagaa, will provide more high-quality fish for human consumption, while significantly increasing fishing earnings. Furthermore, by utilizing biowaste (frames, skin, and fish mouth), revenues from Nile perch could be increased up to thrice. Furthermore, if fishing could target maximum sustainable yield (MSY), landings of Nile perch and Dagaa could increase significantly in the long run. These, combined with investments in other areas such as lacustrine tourism and recreation, as well as fish cage culture, can help the Lake Victoria region's blue economy expand.","[Nyamweya, C.

Coffee by-products for example (i.e. coffee pulp, coffee husks, silver skin, spent coffee, etc.) have been in-vestigated in different forms either as a source of antioxidant and valuable chemicals and as a filler in composites. A new valorization route for coffee silver skin (CSS), up to now just sent to damping, is here investigated: particulate bio-composites based on poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA), an aliphatic biodegradable polyester commer-cially available, have been formulated with up to a 30 wt% of CSS, in order to prepare mulching films for agriculture. The bacterial analysis of the filler indeed, has underlined the presence of potential Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria species, mainly ascribed to the Bacillus genus, which can survive both the roasting and the compounding processes. The obtained composites have been characterized mechanically and thermally and their hydrophilic nature has been investigated by measuring their contact angle. Eventually, the bacteria release from the composite films has been examined by means of in-vitro tests. The plant growth promoting capability of the films was preliminarily eval-uated in pot experiments using lettuce as a model crop. The composite films were able to release the endogenous bac-teria in the soil and to stimulate plant and root growth of the assayed crop. The possibility to produce functionalized biodegradable mulching films by recycling agricultural wastes can thus be forecast, highlighting potential multiple ad-vantages in terms of soil preservation/fertilization, decrease of polymeric materials in mulching products, exploitation of a waste.","[Pagliarini, Elia; Gaggia, Francesca; Di Gioia, Diana] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Via Fanin 40, Bologna, Italy; [Totaro, Grazia; Saccani, Andrea; Sisti, Laura] Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Via Terracini 28, Bologna, Italy; [Lancellotti, Isabella] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Engn E Ferrari, Via Vivarelli 10, Modena, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia,"Totaro, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Via Terracini 28, Bologna, Italy.",grazia.totaro@unibo.it,"Totaro, Grazia/AAO-6157-2021; Lancellotti, Isabella/M-3058-2015","Totaro, Grazia/0000-0002-7388-8894",,,,,61,12,14,6,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

However, to date, single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst is not available for SO3 decomposition reaction, which is a key reactions in the hydrogen economy. Using state of the art density functional theory, we report a novel single Ag atom alloy Pt catalyst in the sub-nanometer length scale (AgPt9@Al2O3) showing superior catalytic behavior for SO3 decomposition. It was found that alloying the alumina-supported platinum nanocluster with a single Ag atom lowers the activation barrier for S-O bond breaking by more than 50% in comparison with the pristine platinum counterpart. Activation barrier for AgPt9@Al2O3 catalyst is 0.52 eV, which is the lowest of any platinum based catalyst reported so far. At variance with pure Pt-10@Al2O3, which tries to detach from the support during decomposition reaction, single atom alloy (SAA) nanocluster AgPt9@Al2O3 enhances binding with support, thus strengthening sintering resistance. Notably, influence of single Ag atom is also observed at larger length scale, i.e., at Pt(111) slab, where single Ag atom substituted surface Ag1Pt(111) shows approximate to 30% reduction in activation barrier in contrast to a pristine surface. Single Ag atom works in bifunctional mode as it not only reduces the activation barrier, but also simultaneously weakly adsorbs the reaction product SO2, signifying relatively easier desorption and better recyclability. Deeper location of silver d-electrons and lesser electronegativity of silver is responsible for the better performance of single Ag atom alloyed Pt catalyst. We strongly believe that these remarkable results will open new avenues for future designing and fabrication of cost-effective catalysts for SO3 decomposition.","[Nigam, Sandeep; Majumder, Chiranjib] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Div Chem, Bombay 400094, Maharashtra, India",Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC),"Nigam, S (通讯作者)，Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Div Chem, Bombay 400094, Maharashtra, India.",snigam.jpr@gmail.com; chimaju@barc.gov.in,,,,,,,66,26,27,8,167,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2040-3364,2040-3372,,NANOSCALE,Nanoscale,NOV 28,2018,10,44,,,,,20599,20610,,10.1039/c8nr05179h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8nr05179h,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,HA7DX,30277248,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000450442500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores the application of dry crude pomegranate peel extract (PPE) as a bio-input for medicinal gels with wound healing properties. PPE was extracted via percolation in ethanol and freeze-dried. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry identified key bioactive compounds: gallic acid, punicalagin, punicalin, ellagic acid, and citric acid, recognized for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and healing properties. In vitro assays revealed low hemolytic activity, non-cytotoxicity, significant fibroblast proliferation, and robust antioxidant activity (95.99% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging at 100 mu g/mL). A carbomer gel containing 2.5% w/w of the extract effectively promoted wound healing in rats, with performance comparable to that of silver sulfadiazine ointment, while demonstrating no microbial contamination during the process. These findings position PPE as a promising, sustainable, and effective alternative for wound-care pharmacotherapy, addressing both medical needs and environmental sustainability.","[Goncalves de Melo, Rita Cristina; Oliveira Villanova, Janaina Cecilia] Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Exact Nat & Hlth Sci CCENS, Pharmaceut Prod Dev Lab, BR-29500000 Alegre, ES, Brazil; [Mantovanelli, Vitoria Ribeiro; de Paula, Geanne Aparecida] Sao Paulo State Univ, UNESP, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drugs & Pharmaceut, Araraquara, Brazil; [Ferreira, Daiana Freitas; Conceicao Santos, Mario Ferreira; Resende, Juliana Alves; Boeloni, Jankerle Neves; Oliveira Villanova, Janaina Cecilia] Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Agr & Engn Sci, Grad Program Vet Sci, Alegre, Brazil; [Romagna, Rodrigo de Almeida; Borges Monteiro, Jessica Raquel; Resende, Juliana Alves; Kitagawa, Rodrigo Rezende; Oliveira Villanova, Janaina Cecilia] Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Hlth Sci, Grad Program Pharmaceut Sci, Vitoria, Brazil; [Severi, Juliana Aparecida; Meira, Eduardo Frizzera] Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Exact Nat & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm & Nutr, Alegre, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo,"Villanova, JC (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Exact Nat & Hlth Sci CCENS, Pharmaceut Prod Dev Lab, BR-29500000 Alegre, ES, Brazil.;Santos, MF; Villanova, JC (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Agr & Engn Sci, Grad Program Vet Sci, Alegre, Brazil.;Villanova, JC (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Espirito Santo UFES, Ctr Hlth Sci, Grad Program Pharmaceut Sci, Vitoria, Brazil.",mariosantos408@gmail.com; pharmacotecnica@yahoo.com.br,"Gonçalves de Melo, Rita Cristina/MCK-5634-2025; Resende, Juliana/D-7513-2015; Meira, Eduardo/IVV-7442-2023; Villanova, J./E-5545-2013; Dias, Daiana/KJM-1668-2024; Boeloni, Jankerle/AGI-7942-2022; Kitagawa, Rodrigo/E-8639-2019; Santos, Mario F.

In developing countries, food production and waste management challenges are exacerbated by inefficient storage, transportation, and consumer waste. Fruit waste, rich in bioactive compounds, is a viable substrate for producing metal oxide nanoparticles, which are then utilized in creating active food packaging materials. These materials significantly extend the postharvest shelf life of perishable goods. Key findings include the effectiveness of various fruit wastes as mediating agents in the synthesis of nanoparticles, the enhanced biological activity of these nanoparticles in packaging applications, and the recent advancements in incorporating metal oxides in packaging materials. Despite the potential, the review also acknowledges existing limitations and regulatory challenges in this application. Ultimately, this green synthesis pathway aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, aimed at halving food waste by 2030, and highlights the transformational impact of integrating waste management with innovative food packaging solutions.","[Leta, Tshiamo B.; Adeyemi, Jerry O.; Fawole, Olaniyi A.] Univ Johannesburg, Postharvest & Agroproc Res Ctr, Dept Bot & Plant Biotechnol, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Fawole, OA (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Postharvest & Agroproc Res Ctr, Dept Bot & Plant Biotechnol, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",olaniyif@uj.ac.za,"Fawole, Olaniyi/AAD-8908-2022; ADEYEMI, JERRY/N-6381-2019","ADEYEMI, JERRY/0000-0002-7769-5264",National Research Foundation of South Africa [129295]; University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg; Academy of Finland (AKA) [129295] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This work is based on research supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number: 129295) and the University Research Committee at the University of Johannesburg.,,268,6,6,19,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4292,2212-4306,,FOOD BIOSCI,Food Biosci.,JUN,2024,59,,,,,,,,104151,10.1016/j.fbio.2024.104151,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2024.104151,,APR 2024,21,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,SM2O8,,hybrid,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001234806900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Activated carbon adsorption has been the primary commercial approach to recover gold from Au(CN)(2)(-) solution since the 1970 s. In the 21st century, new materials exploration and many experimental and modeling works were conducted to understand more of the adsorption mechanisms of Au(CN)(2)(-) onto activated carbon. In this paper, we reviewed the recent materials for gold recovery, such as activated carbon materials, graphene based-materials, and a few other materials. Experimental and modeling studies related to the adsorption mechanism of Au(CN)(2)(-) onto activated carbon were also reviewed, which provided a better understanding of the adsorption process.

This study evaluated the use of a mechanical pre-treatment in the thermal recycling of c-Si crystalline PV modules, which were submitted to recycling routes to separate and concentrate the materials of interest. The first route was constituted by only thermal treatment, and the second route was constituted by a mechanical pre-treatment to remove the polymers from the backsheet, and subsequent thermal treatment. The exclusively thermal route was performed at 500 degrees C, varying dwell times between 30 and 120 minutes in the furnace. In this route, the best results were obtained in 90 minutes, with a maximum degradation of 68% of the polymeric mass. In route 2, a micro-grinder rotary tool was used to remove the polymers from the backsheet and, subsequently, thermal treatment performed at 500 degrees C, with dwell times in the furnace ranging between 5 and 30 minutes. The mechanical pre-treatment removed about 10.32 +/- 0.92% of the mass of the laminate PV module. By this route, only 20 minutes of thermal treatment were needed for the total decomposition of the polymers, that is, a reduction of 78% in the oven time. With route 2, it was possible to obtain a concentrate with 30 times more silver than the PV laminate and 40 times more than a high-concentration ore. Furthermore, with route 2 it was possible to reduce the environmental impact of heat treatment and energy consumption.

The results indicated that the most significant type of WEEE based on relative potential risk is liquid crystal display television, while the least significant types of WEEE are refrigerator and washing machine. However, PCBs also contain precious metals (gold, silver, and palladium) which are crucial for WEEE recycling economy. Thus, the ratio between precious metals and toxic heavy metal was determined as a simple tool to assess the cost and benefit.

Ag and its compounds are historically well-known as antibacterial agents, whilst polyethyleneimine (PEI) has good stabilizing and adsorption properties. In this work, colloidal Ag nanomaterials (diameter similar to 2.6 +/- 1.1 nm) produced using PEI as the capping agent demonstrated potential as antifouling photocatalysts for water treatment applications. The photocatalytic effect of Ag-PEI was studied using UV-visible spectrophotometry on the decomposition of methylene blue, with a 90.2% peak reduction of its UV-visible spectral peaks and decoloration recorded after 90 minutes of UV-irradiation.

Policy makers, futures traders and individual investors are very concerned about copper prices. In a recent paper, we use an artificial intelligence model long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict copper prices. To improve the efficiency of long short-term memory (LSTM) model, we introduced a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find the best combination of hyperparameters. The feature engineering problem of the AI model is then solved by correlation analysis. Three economic indicators, West Texas Intermediate Oil Price, Gold Price and Silver Price, which are highly correlated with copper prices, were selected as inputs to be used in the training and forecasting model.

Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections.","[Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi; Choi, Youngsok; Do, Jeong Tae; Park, Chankyu; Hong, Kwonho; Kim, Jin-Hoi; Song, Hyuk] Konkuk Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biotechnol, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Qasim, Muhammad] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Ctr Bioengn & Nanomed, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",Konkuk University; University of Otago,"Song, H (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Stem Cell & Regenerat Biotechnol, Seoul 05029, South Korea.",sangiliyandi@konkuk.ac.kr; muhammadqasim.qasim@otago.ac.nz; choiys3969@konkuk.ac.kr; dojt@konkuk.ac.kr; chankyu@konkuk.ac.kr; hongk@konkuk.ac.kr; jhkim541@konkuk.ac.kr; songh@konkuk.ac.kr,"Park, Chankyu/D-8775-2011; kim, jin-hoi/HDN-0829-2022; Qasim, Muhammad/E-3152-2017","Park, Chankyu/0000-0003-4855-2210; Qasim, Muhammad/0000-0003-0279-5305; Choi, Youngsok/0000-0002-3862-4105; song, hyuk/0000-0001-9258-8304; kim, jin-hoi/0000-0003-1232-5307; Do, Jeong Tae/0000-0001-6721-1441; Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi/0000-0001-9924-8433",Konkuk University,Konkuk University,This paper was supported by Konkuk University in 2018.,,217,149,152,3,56,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,SEP,2020,10,9,,,,,,,1645,10.3390/nano10091645,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano10091645,,,29,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,OG2HQ,32825737,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000581712200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the former trials, vixens of the same-age and origin acted as stimulus animals (N = 6), and both test and stimulus foxes could decide their own visit durations to a shared compartment. Their motives for visiting this 'social compartment' were examined by recording their behaviour during social contact. When access was almost free (a baseline fixed ratio schedule of 1) the test vixens visited the stimulus fox 30.3 +/- 4.3 times and spent 45% of the time together per 24 h. The stimulus foxes spent on average 80% per 24 h in the shared compartment and visited this cage 40.7 +/- 9.6 times per 24 h. When higher costs were imposed, the test vixens proved willing to pay to access the stimulus vixens and the average maximum price paid for contact was 38.3 +/- 8.3% of the price paid for food when hungry. During the time spent together, the stimulus foxes made use of their opportunity to leave the cage, on average 1.43 +/- 0.20 times per visit. The behaviour recordings showed that during initial encounters the vixens would fight to establish dominance, and in four of the pairs the test subject emerged as the dominant individual. However, during subsequent interactions, no serious aggression was recorded and social behaviour was characterised by higher levels of sniffing and grooming (23.7 +/- 4.3 times/h), play signals (10.5 +/- 4.1 times/h) and agonistic displays (5.5 +/- 2.5 times/h). Not all of the time together was used for social interaction and during the observation period, the vixens allocated 33.1 +/- 6.9% of the time to synchronous resting. We conclude that young silver fox vixens were motivated for social contact, and that this contact was beneficial for welfare due to the low level of aggression and the occurrence of grooming and play.

J,"Warnecke-Berger, H",,,,"Warnecke-Berger, Hannes",,,"Remittances, the Rescaling of Social Conflicts, and the Stasis of Elite Rule in El Salvador",LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,El Salvador; Migration; Remittances; Transnationalism; Elite rule,MODEL,"Remittances are the dominant factor in the contemporary economy of El Salvador, which is enjoying a new comparative advantage in the international economic system-the export of cheap labor to the Global North and particularly the United States. The Salvadoran economy is part of a transnational economic space, but this space is perverse: Although the poor are nominally receiving more money, remittances cause them to be caught in a vicious cycle of economic instability. At the same time, the elites are able to access remittances indirectly by becoming a Keynesian oligarchy-an oligarchy that extracts wealth by controlling the demand structure of the economy instead of production. Remittances represent bread and butter for the poor and a vehicle for transnationalization for the rich, and this leads to a new stasis of elite rule: remittances provoke the rescaling of social conflicts in favor of elites. Transnationalism in this regard must be interpreted as an elite strategy for suppressing the bargaining power of the subaltern class. In this transnational remittances economy, opportunities for the subaltern class and migrants to participate directly in reshaping this economic space are limited or nonexistent. As a consequence, they must rely on translocal moral economies linking migrants with their families at home, where they are still able to impose some control. Meanwhile, elites foster transnationalism by dismantling these very modes of control. In this sense, remittances are the silver bullet for facilitating neoliberalism in the Global South. In El Salvador, they produce ultrastability for the oligarchy and chaos for the poor. Las remesas son el factor dominante en la economia contemporanea de El Salvador, que goza de una nueva ventaja comparativa en el sistema economico internacional en la exportacion de mano de obra barata al Norte Global y particularmente a los Estados Unidos. La economia salvadorena es parte de un espacio economico transnacional, pero este espacio es perverso: aunque los pobres reciben nominalmente mas dinero, las remesas hacen que se encuentren atrapados en un circulo vicioso de inestabilidad economica. Al mismo tiempo, las elites pueden acceder a las remesas indirectamente al convertirse en una oligarquia keynesiana- una oligarquia que extrae riqueza controlando la estructura de la demanda de la economia en lugar de la produccion. Las remesas representan el pan de cada dia para los pobres y un vehiculo para la transnacionalizacion de los ricos, y esto lleva a una nueva estasis del gobierno de la elites: las remesas provocan la reescalada de los conflictos sociales a favor de las elites. El transnacionalismo a este respecto debe interpretarse como una estrategia de elites para suprimir el poder de negociacion de la clase subalterna. En esta economia transnacional de remesas, las oportunidades para que la clase subalterna y los migrantes participen directamente en la remodelacion de este espacio economico son limitadas o inexistentes. Como consecuencia, deben contar con las economias morales translocales que vinculan a los migrantes con sus familias en El Salvador, donde aun es posible imponer cierto control. Mientras tanto, las elites fomentan el transnacionalismo desmantelando estos mismos modos de control. En este sentido, las remesas son la bala de plata para facilitar el neoliberalismo en el Sur Global. En El Salvador, producen ultra estabilidad para la oligarquia y caos para los pobres.","[Warnecke-Berger, Hannes] Univ Kassel, Dept Int & Intersocietal Relat, Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Warnecke-Berger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Int & Intersocietal Relat, Kassel, Germany.",,,,,,,,81,10,12,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0094-582X,1552-678X,,LAT AM PERSPECT,Lat.

J,"Ackermann, L",,,,"Ackermann, Lutz",,,Metalla-electrocatalyzed C-H Activation by Earth-Abundant 3d Metals and Beyond,ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Review,,,,,,,LIGHT PHOTOREDOX CATALYSIS; BOND FUNCTIONALIZATION; ORGANIC ELECTROSYNTHESIS; DIRECT ARYLATION; GREEN CHEMISTRY; PALLADIUM; ANNULATION; OXIDATION; ALLENES; ECONOMY,"CONSPECTUS: To improve the efficacy of molecular syntheses, researchers wish to capitalize upon the selective modification of otherwise inert C-H bonds. The past two decades have witnessed considerable advances in coordination chemistry that have set the stage for transformative tools for C-H functionalizations. Particularly, oxidative C-H/C-H and C-H/Het-H transformations have gained major attention because they avoid all elements of substrate prefunctionalization. Despite considerable advances, oxidative C-H activations have been dominated by precious transition metal catalysts based on palladium, ruthenium, iridium, and rhodium, thus compromising the sustainable nature of the overall C-H activation approach. The same holds true for the predominant use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants for the regeneration of the active catalyst, prominently featuring hypervalent iodine(III), copper(II), and silver(I) oxidants. Thereby, stoichiometric quantities of undesired byproducts are generated, which are preventive for applications of C-H activation on scale. In contrast, the elegant merger of homogeneous metal-catalyzed C-H activation with molecular electrosynthesis bears the unique power to achieve outstanding levels of oxidant and resource economy. Thus, in contrast to classical electrosyntheses by substrate control, metalla-electrocatalysis holds huge and largely untapped potential for oxidative C-H activations with unmet site selectivities by means of catalyst control. While indirect electrolysis using precious palladium complexes has been realized, less toxic and less expensive base metal catalysts feature distinct beneficial assets toward sustainable resource economy. In this Account, I summarize the emergence of electrocatalyzed C-H activation by earth-abundant 3d base metals and beyond, with a topical focus on contributions from our laboratories through November 2019. Thus, cobalt electrocatalysis was identified as a particularly powerful platform for a wealth of C-H transformations, including C-H oxygenations and C-H nitrogenations as well as C-H activations with alkynes, alkenes, allenes, isocyanides, and carbon monoxide, among others. As complementary tools, catalysts based on nickel, copper, and very recently iron have been devised for metalla-electrocatalyzed C-H activations. Key to success were detailed mechanistic insights, prominently featuring oxidation-induced reductive elimination scenarios. Likewise, the development of methods that make use of weak O-coordination benefited from crucial insights into the catalyst's modes of action by experiment, in operando spectroscopy, and computation. Overall, metalla-electrocatalyzed C-H activations have thereby set the stage for molecular syntheses with unique levels of resource economy. These electrooxidative C-H transformations overall avoid the use of chemical oxidants and are frequently characterized by improved chemoselectivities. Hence, the ability to dial in the redox potential at the minimum level required for the desired transformation renders electrocatalysis an ideal platform for the functionalization of structurally complex molecules with sensitive functional groups. This strategy was, inter alia, successfully applied to scale-up by continuous flow and the step-economical assembly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.","[Ackermann, Lutz] Georg August Univ, Inst Organ & Biomol Chem, Tammannstr 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Ackermann, L (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ, Inst Organ & Biomol Chem, Tammannstr 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",Lutz.Ackermann@chemie.uni-goettingen.de,"Ackermann, Lutz/C-8117-2014","Ackermann, Lutz/0000-0001-7034-8772",DFG (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz award) [SPP 1807]; Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation; CSC,DFG (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz award)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); CSC,"Generous financial support by the DFG (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz award, SPP 1807), the Alexander-von-Humboldt foundation, and the CSC is gratefully acknowledged.

Application of chemical/biological fertilizers and pesticides are the mainstays for any agricultural economy. However, there are unintended consequences of using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The environment and ecological balance are adversely affected by their usage. Biofertilizers and biopesticides counter some undesired environmental effects of chemical fertilizers/pesticides; despite some drawbacks associated with their use. The recent developments in nanotechnology offer promise toward sustainable agriculture. Sustainable agriculture involves addressing the concerns about agriculture as well as the environment. This review briefs about important nanomaterials used in agriculture as nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, and a combination called nanobiofertilizers. Both nanofertilizers and nanopesticides enable slow and sustained release besides their eco-friendly nature. They can be tailored to the specific needs of to crop. Nanofertilizers also offer greater stress tolerance and, therefore, are of considerable value in the era of climate change. Furthermore, nanofertilizers/ nanopesticides are applied in minute amounts, reducing transportation costs associated and thus positively affecting the economy. Their uses extend beyond such as if nanoparticles (NPs) are used at high concentrations; they affect plant pathogens adversely. Polymer-based biodegradable nanofertilizers and nanopesticides offer various benefits. There is also a dark side to the use of nanomaterials in agriculture. Nanotechnology often in-volves the use of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, which might get access to human bodies leading to their accumulation through bio-magnification. Although their effects on human health are not known, NPs may reach toxic concentrations in soil and runoff into rivers, and other water bodies with their removal to become a huge economic burden. Nevertheless, a risk-benefit analysis of nanoformulations must be ensured before their application in sustainable agriculture.","[Arora, Smriti] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Hlth Sci & technol, Dept Allied Hlth Sci, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttaranchal, India; [Maity, Dipak] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Dept Chem Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttaranchal, India; [Murmu, Gajiram; Saha, Sumit] CSIR Inst Minerals & Mat Technol, Mat Chem Dept, Bhubaneswar 751013, Orissa, India; [Murmu, Gajiram; Saha, Sumit] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mukherjee, Koel] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Bioengn & Biotechnol, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India",University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Minerals & Materials Technology (IMMT); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR); Birla Institute of Technology Mesra,"Maity, D (通讯作者)，Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Dept Chem Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttaranchal, India.",dipakmaity@gmail.com,"Maity, Dipak/E-6863-2011; Murmu, Gajiram/IZF-0065-2023; Saha, Sumit/ACT-5062-2022","Mukherjee, Koel/0000-0001-9897-5217; Saha, Sumit/0000-0002-7081-9965","CSIR; CSIR-Institute of Minerals & Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, India [CSIR-IMMT-OLP-112]; University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES)","CSIR(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); CSIR-Institute of Minerals & Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, India; University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES)","GM acknowledges the CSIR for providing a Junior Research Fellowship.

The chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and morphology of nAg-TC, and active surface functional groups involved in adsorption were identified using BET, FESEM-EDX, FTIR, TGA, XPS, and XRD. The nAg-TC matrix was found to be heterogeneous, mesoporous, thermostable, with rich in active surface functional groups (-OH, =NH, =CH, C=C, C=O, C=N, and C=C), and nAg as a dopant material. The dye adsorption results indicated the maximum removal efficiency (RhB = 95.89%, CR = 94.10%) at 300 K for rhodamine B (RhB) and Congo red (CR) concentrations of 25 mg L-1 and 22.5 mg L-1, respectively. The present investigation agreed with Freundlich isotherm (R-CR(2):0.991; R-RhB(2):0.993) and pseudo-second order kinetic (R-CR(2):0.999; R-RhB(2):0.999) model, indicating overall adsorption of RhB and CR through spontaneous and exothermic chemisorption on the heterogeneous surface of nAg-TC. The mechanism of RhB and CR adsorption was complex where nAg-TC, possessing the synergistic effects of TLB and nAg, showed surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, and H-bonding, leading to chemisorption. Study showed excellent reusability of spent nAg-TC, and commendable treatment efficiency for dye-laden real industrial effluents.

Forecasting the price of crude oil is difficult owing to its complicated, nonlinear, and chaotic nature in economic history. Multiple variables influence crude oil prices, such as the economic history, economic cycle, international relations, and geopolitics. Predicting the price of crude oil is a complex but valuable endeavor. Crude oil price forecasting is done using historical data (time series method) or dependent variables/factors (regression method) using traditional econometric or machine learning models. In this study, we use both methods (regression and time series) to examine the prediction performance of both models (econometric and machine learning models) for daily WTI crude oil prices covering the period December 18, 2011, through December 31, 2018. We present a performance analysis of conventional econometric models (ARIMA, GARCH, and OLS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression models, and ANN Time Series models to compare their results to find out the best-performing method (time series or regression) and the best model (econometric or machine learning model). Based on our study results, we propose a novel Artificial Neural Network model to improve the prediction performance of existing models by adjusting the bias and weights of ANN hidden layers. We used historical prices of 14 different variables, including gold, silver, S&P500, USD Index price, and US-EU conversion rates for regression models, whereas historical time series data of WTI crude oil for time series models. Analysis of the results reveals that the performance of our proposed model remained better than all tested models. The comparative results of existing models show that the overall performance of Neural Networks remained better than econometric models. Our results have substantial implications for governments, businesses, and investors, and for the sustainable growth of economies that rely on energy.","[Xu, Zilin] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Hist, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Mohsin, Muhammad] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Kaleem] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ma, Xiaoyu] Wenzhou Business Coll, Sch Finance & Trade, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China",Anhui Normal University; Jiangsu University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Ma, XY (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Business Coll, Sch Finance & Trade, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.",591370172@qq.com; m.mohsin3801@yahoo.com; kaleem_7198@hotmail.com; mxy@wzbc.edu.cn,"Ma, Xiaoyu/JTS-9783-2023; Mohsin, Muhammad/JVO-5672-2024","ULLAH, KALEEM/0000-0001-6117-1477",,,,,56,51,51,26,182,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

We explore methodologies for evaluating sorbents as additives to organic agricultural wastes to retain nitrogen in an exchangeable form and deliver at rates that approximate the uptake capacity of roots. Focussing on ammonium (NH4+) as the main inorganic nitrogen form in the studied wastes (sugarcane millmud, poultry litter), we tested geo-sorbents and biochar for their ability to retain NH4+. Sorption capacity was ranked palagonite < bentonite, biochar, vermiculite < chabazite, clinoptilolite (5.7 to 24.3 mg NH4+ g(-1) sorbent). Sorbent-waste formulations were analysed for sorption capacity, leaching and fluxes of NH4+. Ammonium-sorption capacity broadly translated to sorbent-waste formulations with clinoptilolite conferring the strongest NH4+ attenuation (80%), and palagonite the lowest (7%). A 1: 1 ratio of sorbent: waste achieved stronger sorption than a 0.5: 1 ratio, and similar sorption as a 1: 1.5 ratio. In line with these results, clinoptilolite-amended wastes had the lowest in situ NH4+ fluxes, which exceeded the NH4+ uptake capacity (I-max) of sugarcane and sorghum roots 9 to 84-fold, respectively. Less efficient sorbent-waste formulations and un-amended wastes exceeded Imax of crop roots up to 274-fold. Roots preferentially colonized stronger sorbent-waste formulations and avoided weaker ones, suggesting that lower NH4+ fluxes generate a more favourable growth environment. This study contributes methodologies to identify suitable sorbents to formulate organic wastes as next-generation fertilizers with view of a crop's nutrient physiology. Efficient repurposing of wastes can improve nutrient use efficiency in agriculture and support the circular nutrient economy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Any dent in this economical structure may have a severe impact on a country's population. With rising climate change and increasing pollution, the agricultural sector is experiencing significant damage. Over time this cumulative damage will affect the integrity of food crops and create food security issues around the world. Therefore, an early warning system is needed to detect possible stress on food crops. Here we present a review of the recent developments in nanomaterial-based Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrates which could be utilized to monitor agricultural crop responses to natural and anthropogenic stress. Initially, our review delves into diverse and cost-effective strategies for fabricating SERS substrates, emphasizing their intelligent utilization across various agricultural scenarios. In the second phase of our review, we spotlight the specific application of SERS in addressing critical food security issues. By detecting nutrients, hormones, and effector molecules in plants, SERS provides valuable insights into plant health. Furthermore, our exploration extends to the detection of contaminants, chemicals, and foodborne pathogens within plants, showcasing the versatility of SERS in ensuring food safety. The cumulative knowledge derived from these discussions illustrates the transformative potential of SERS in bolstering the agricultural economy. By enhancing precision in nutrient management, monitoring plant health, and enabling rapid detection of harmful substances, SERS emerges as a pivotal tool in promoting sustainable and secure agricultural practices. Its integration into agricultural processes not only augments productivity but also establishes a robust defence against potential threats to crop yield and food quality. As SERS continues to evolve, its role in shaping the future of agriculture becomes increasingly pronounced, promising a paradigm shift in how we approach and address challenges in food production and safety.","[Mahanty, Shouvik] Saha Inst Nucl Phys, Dept Atom Energy, Sect 1,AF Block, Kolkata 700064, West Bengal, India; [Majumder, Santanu; Paul, Richard; Boroujerdi, Ramin] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, England; [Valsami-Jones, Eugenia] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, England; [Laforsch, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth, Germany; [Laforsch, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany",Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics; Bournemouth University; University of Birmingham; University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth,"Majumder, S (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, England.",smajumder@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Laforsch, Christian/JOZ-3270-2023; Valsami-Jones, Eva/I-1736-2016","Mahanty, Shouvik/0000-0002-8243-9935",Department of Atomic Energy (DAE); European Commission [H2020-MSCA-IF-2020 - 101031051]; Royal Society Wolfson Fellowship [RSWF\R2\192007]; Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics [SINP/Estt./B&SG/ SG/Appt./2022],Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Royal Society Wolfson Fellowship(Royal Society UK); Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics(Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics),S.Mahanty would like to thank Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (Letter No. SINP/Estt./B&SG/& SG/Appt./2022) for providing the Research Associate fellowship.

Concerning agriculture, the cropping systems are almost based on exploiting non-renewable resources. In recent years, increasing interest has been devoted to reusing agricultural, food and other biomass wastes, considered relevant as they can be seen as resources rich in compounds that can find numerous applications. Biomass biorefining has been successfully applied and has opened up sustainable alternatives to the disposal of agricultural, agroindustrial and food wastes.In this area, an emerging, smart and environmentally friendly way to reduce the impact of waste on the environment is to obtain innovative materials for agriculture. Therefore, as part of biobased strategies, the use of waste biomass to obtain biostimulants and biogenic nanoparticles for crops has recently been proposed. Some research has shown that appropriate biostimulants and biobased nanomaterials have the potential to counteract some of the problems that plague agriculture. The above materials can improve crop performance, enhance crop tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and improve plant nutrition.In light of the above, this review aspires, in the first part, to provide an overview of the ideas and central points that characterize the concept of bioeconomy and circular economy. In the second part, on the other hand, the most recent studies related to the valorization of various types of wastes leading to innovative biobased materials and their application in agriculture are presented. In particular, biostimulants and nanoparticles obtained through biogenic synthesis using agroindustrial and plant residues have been considered.

This review evaluates the application of SAs for the generation of products that can serve as (i) antimicrobial agents or disinfectants, (ii) materials for civil construction, (iii) catalysts, (iv) fertilizers, and (v) secondary adsorbents. The importance of SAs configuration in terms of functional groups, surface area and pore morphology played a crucial role in their reutilization. The SAs-laden silver ions (Ag+) strongly inhibit (similar to 99%) the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus microbes found in drinking and wastewaters. The intra-solidification of SAs containing toxic metal pollutants (As-3(+) and F-) with cementitious materials can effectively reduce their leaching below permissible limits of USEPA standards for their utility as additives in construction work. The existence of transition metal ions (Cu-2(+), Cr-3(+/6+), Ni-2(+)) on the surface of SAs boosted activity and selectivity towards the desired product during catalytic oxidation, degradation, and conversion processes. The thermally recycled SAs can assist in the secondary adsorption of pollutants from another waste solution due to a larger surface area (> 1000 m(2) g(-1)). However, there are chances that the SAs discussed above will contain traces of PFAS. The article summarizes the challenges, performance efficacy, and future prospects at the end of each value-added product. We also highlight critical challenges for managing PFAS-laden SAs and stimulate new perspectives to minimize PFAS in air, water, and soils.","[Nighojkar, Amrita; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian] Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Nano Surface Texturing Lab, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Sangal, Vikas Kumar] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol MNIT, Dept Chem Engn, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Dixit, Fuhar] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT); National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur; University of British Columbia,"Kandasubramanian, B (通讯作者)，Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Nano Surface Texturing Lab, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",meetkbs@gmail.com,"Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian/M-2709-2014; Sangal, Vikas Kumar/GZM-2104-2022; Nighojkar, Amrita/AAB-7048-2020","Sangal, Vikas K/0000-0002-9282-6496; Nighojkar, Amrita/0000-0001-6519-3892; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian/0000-0003-4257-8807",,,,,156,15,15,12,56,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

We have incorporated four mostly trading metals (i.e., Gold, Palladium, Silver, & Platinum) & Crude oil. Although out-comes of Linear Granger causality test show no causal relation between COVID-19 & oil and precious metal prices for both cases (i.e., online searching trends and actual events), the outcomes of the non-parametric test revealed the existence of non-linear association among constructs. Non-parametric test results revealed that COVID-19 significantly influences the prices of oil and precious metals. Therefore, we conclude that policy-makers need to contemplate pandemic risk as most critical risk factor for stability of market when developing policies for the market and economy.

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rapid, reliable and easy to-use approaches for bacterial detection. Herein, we present a new detection strategy termed as `DNAzyme-Integrated Plasmonic Nanosensor' (DIPNs) that can selectively detect target bacteria in a simple, inexpensive and culture-free process, which combines real-time DNAzyme-based sensor and enzyme-responsive nanoplasmonic biosensor system. The DIPNs platform takes advantage of a bacteria-specific RNA-cleaving DNAzyme probe as the molecular recognition element and enzyme-responsive plasmonic nanoparticles' localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) as the signal readout. Using Escherichia coil (E. coil) as a model analyte, we demonstrated that the DIPNs system can provide the fast and low concentration (down to 50 bacteria per mL) quantification of E. coli even in the complex fluids (e.g., milk, serum, juice) with naked eyes, which would be expected for the detection of bacterial pathogens in the simple, low-cost and on-site manner.","[Yu, Fang; Li, Yun; Li, Mingyu; Tang, Longhua; He, Jian-Jun] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Opt Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Modern Opt Instrumentat, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Tang, LH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Opt Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Modern Opt Instrumentat, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.",lhtang@zju.edu.cn,"Yu, Fang/C-2933-2014; Tang, Longhua/G-5412-2011; Li, Ming-Yu/AAH-6879-2020; HE, JIAN-JUN/A-4944-2009","HE, JIAN-JUN/0000-0002-3297-389X; Tang, Longhua/0000-0002-3833-3113","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61405176, 61535010]; Natural Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province [LY14B050004, LY16F050001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016QNA5001]; National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China [2014AA06A504]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China),"This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61405176 and 61535010), Natural Sciences Fund of Zhejiang Province (Nos.

This study aims to evaluate the asymmetric relationships between these factors and environmental degradation across 10 NICs, including Brazil, India, South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, South Africa, Malaysia, and the Philippines, from 1995 to 2023. Using the CS-ARDL model, our study demonstrates that while energy costs and renewable energy consumption reduce environmental degradation, gold prices and fossil fuel consumption significantly increase ecological harm. Additionally, the study employs FGLS, CS-DL, AMG, and Driscoll-Kray to verify the robustness of these findings. Notably, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis holds true in these economies. Key results show that a 1 % increase in renewable energy use decreases emissions by 0.7 %, while a 1 % rise in gold prices correlates with a 0.5 % increase in pollution levels. These findings underscore the need for NICs to implement green investments, promote renewable energy, and initiate structural reforms to ensure sustainable development.","[Xu, Tiancheng] Wuhan Polytech Univ, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430048, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Feng, Chun] Guangzhou Xinhua Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Guluzada, Esmira] Azerbaijan State Univ Econ UNEC, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Chao, Chen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Wuhan Polytechnic University; Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Azerbaijan State University of Economics (UNEC); Nanjing Normal University,"Feng, C (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Xinhua Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou 510520, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xutc.2019@tsinghua.org.cn; fc1031351@163.com; Esmira_Guluzada@unec.edu.az; Chenchao836@gmail.com,,,,,,,69,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-467X,2211-4688,,ENERGY STRATEG REV,Energy Strateg.

Here, a bottom-up strategy is reported to develop biomimetic nanofibrous aerogels with superelastic and conductive networks by assembling Ag nanowires in a 3D SiO2 nanofibrous skeleton via freeze-drying method for safe and efficient water disinfection. Inspired by the prey capture behavior of spiders using their webs, the core of this design is constructing spanning and interconnected networks with millions of conductive nanotips, which could inactivate microbes instantaneously based on the synergistic effect of interception and electroporation. Benefitting from the high porosity (99.81 %), superelasticity, and robust structural stability of the resultant aerogels, an electroporation-disinfection device (EDD) equipped with aerogels exhibits superior bactericidal (>99.9999 %) and virucidal (>99.9 %) performances at low derive voltage (1 V) and high flux (9900 L m- 2 h-1) with energy consumption of 0.83 Wh m- 3.

In the second step, we introduce the implied volatilities of energy and precious metals and analyse their quantile-based causal dependence structure. The estimates of Granger-causality in quantiles suggest that the US-linked economic uncertainty, financial stress, and stock market implied volatility significantly explain the GSCI and its sub-indices at the lower and higher quantiles. Economic uncertainty exhibits stronger impact than financial stress. The comovement between stock market implied volatility and GSCI indices suggests the deepening of the financialisation process.

Groups of microorganisms such as bacteria are accountable for BC synthesis through static or agitated fermentation processes in the presence of competent media. In comparison to static cultivation, agitated cultivation provides the maximum yield of the BC. A pure cellulose BC can positively interact with hydrophilic or hydrophobic biopolymers while being used in the biomedical domain. From the last two decades, the reinforcement of biopolymer-based biocomposites and its applicability with BC have increased in the research field. The harmony of hydrophobic biopolymers can be reduced due to the high moisture content of BC in comparison to hydrophilic biopolymers. Mechanical properties are the important parameters not only in producing green composite but also in dealing with tissue engineering, medical implants, and biofilm. The wide requisition of BC in medical as well as industrial fields has warranted the scaling up of the production of BC with added economy. This review provides a detailed overview of the production and properties of BC and several parameters affecting the production of BC and its biocomposites, elucidating their antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy with an insight to highlight their therapeutic potential.","[Lahiri, Dibyajit; Nag, Moupriya] Univ Engn & Management, Dept Biotechnol, Kolkata 700156, W Bengal, India; [Dutta, Bandita; Ray, Rina Rani] Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Haringhata 700156, W Bengal, India; [Dey, Ankita] Belle Vue Clin, Dept Pathol, Kolkata 700156, W Bengal, India; [Sarkar, Tanmay] Malda Polytech, West Bengal State Council Tech Educ, Malda 732102, W Bengal, India; [Pati, Siddhartha] Skills Innovat & Acad Network SIAN Inst, Balasore 756001, Odisha, India; [Pati, Siddhartha] NatNov Biosci Private Ltd, Balasore 756001, Odisha, India; [Edinur, Hisham Atan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Hlth Sci, Hlth Campus, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Abdul Kari, Zulhisyam] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Agro Based Ind, Jeli 17600, Kelantan, Malaysia; [Mohd Noor, Noor Haslina] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Med Sci, Haematol Dept, Hlth Campus, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia",Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Malaysia Kelantan; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Ray, RR (通讯作者)，Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Haringhata 700156, W Bengal, India.;Noor, NHM (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Med Sci, Haematol Dept, Hlth Campus, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia.",dibyajit.lahiri@uem.edu.in; moupriya.nag@uem.edu.in; bandita2611@gmail.com; ankita.dey16061996@gmail.com; tanmays468@gmail.com; patisiddhartha@gmail.com; edinur@usm.my; zulhisyam.a@umk.edu.my; drhaslina@usm.my; raypumicro@gmail.com,"pati, Siddhartha/Y-1752-2019; Nag, Moupriya/C-5167-2017; Abdul Kari, Dr Zulhisyam/ITT-1080-2023; Sarkar, Tanmay/AAL-7513-2021; Noor, Noor/AAY-9512-2020; Abdul Kari, Zulhisyam/A-2475-2014; Atan, Hisham Atan/F-3946-2014","Abdul Kari, Zulhisyam/0000-0002-3160-7839; Sarkar, Tanmay/0000-0003-3869-1604; Atan, Hisham Atan/0000-0002-3379-6063; pati, Dr. Siddhartha/0000-0002-8276-0008",,,,,119,140,145,6,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

As far as we know, this work is the first time that entropy-driven DNA machine has been used for antibiotics detection. The designed DNA machine is activated by a target-triggered catalytic hairpin assembly to form a spliced DNA walker long-arm. Then the autonomous and progressive spliced walk long-arm on electrode surface via the toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction induces continuous release of signal probe (SP) from three-stranded DNA complex. The freedom of SP leads to the generation of abundant G-quadruplex DNAzyme which can catalyze decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, so an extremely intense electrochemical response is observed. Our spliced DNA walking machine precedes the previous DNA machine in terms of economy and stability due to the strategy of entropy-driven and label-free, and possesses a detection limit to 0.96 pM for detection of ampicillin. Moreover, this DNA machine is expected to detect more analytes by using corresponding aptamer probes. Hence, the entropy-driven DNA walker provides an efficient and practical platform for small molecule analysis.","[Zhang, Rufeng; Qu, Xiaonan; Liu, Su] Univ Jinan, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China; [Li, Shasha; Wang, Jingfeng; Zhao, Yihan; Wang, Yu; Huang, Jiadong] Univ Jinan, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiadong; Yu, Jinghua] Univ Jinan, Key Lab Chem Sensing & Anal Univ Shandong, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China",University of Jinan; University of Jinan; University of Jinan,"Liu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China.",stu_lius@ujn.edu.cn,"zhang, rufeng/KMX-8433-2024; Yu, Jinghua/L-3794-2017; zhao, yihan/KJL-0272-2024; Li, Shasha/AAT-3255-2021",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [31471644]; Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province [2017GSF220009]; University of Jinan Scientific Research Fund [XKY1421]; Doctoral Fundation of University of Jinan [XBS1431]; program for Taishan Scholer of Shandong provinces [ts201712048],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province; University of Jinan Scientific Research Fund; Doctoral Fundation of University of Jinan; program for Taishan Scholer of Shandong provinces,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31471644), the Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province (2017GSF220009), program for Taishan Scholer of Shandong provinces (ts201712048), University of Jinan Scientific Research Fund (Youth Project XKY1421) and the Doctoral Fundation of University of Jinan (XBS1431).",,35,20,21,19,322,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",,0925-4005,,SENSOR ACTUAT B-CHEM,Sens.

However, the various approaches to natural capital welfare accounting results in conflicting indicators of change. It is also the case that the inclusion of natural and social capital components is still scant. This paper addresses this gap by extending the traditional Genuine Savings methodology by including some natural capital components (e.g. flood protection, water purification) and the poverty dimension through a deontological approach. Although not offering a silver bullet solution, our approach proposes a pluralist and pragmatic improvement from 'weak' towards 'stronger' sustainability indicators. Results highlight the availability of data and information produced by different initiatives including the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting guidelines. The empirical application provides Genuine Savings estimates for Italy from 2006 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2015, shedding the light on the importance of natural capital and social considerations at national and regional level.","[Di Gennaro, Valentina; Ferrini, Silvia; Turner, Robert Kerry] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, England; [Ferrini, Silvia] Univ Siena, Siena, Italy; [Ferrini, Silvia] UCL, London, England",University of East Anglia; University of Siena; University of London; University College London,"Di Gennaro, V (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich, England.",v.di-gennaro@uea.ac.uk,"Ferrini, Silvia/AAM-1308-2020","Di Gennaro, Valentina/0000-0001-8731-7112",,,,,56,0,0,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The major motivation for creating liquid optical filters is that they can be pumped in and out of a system to meet transient needs in an application. To demonstrate the versatility of this new class of filters, we present the design of nanofluids for use as long-pass, short-pass, and bandpass optical filters using a simple Monte Carlo optimization procedure. With relatively simple mixtures, we achieve filters with <15% mean-squared deviation in transmittance from conventional filters. We also discuss the current commercial feasibility of nanofluid-based optical filters by including an estimation of today's off-the-shelf cost of the materials. While the limited availability of quality commercial nanoparticles makes it hard to compete with conventional filters, new synthesis methods and economies of scale could enable nanofluid-based optical filters in the near future. As such, this study lays the groundwork for creating a new class of selective optical filters for a wide range of applications, namely communications, electronics, optical sensors, lighting, photography, medicine, and many more.

During pyrolysis, nearly 85-95 wt% of waste PV back sheet is decomposed into reducing gases (CO, CH4, 4 , C2H4) 2 H 4 ) at 500 degrees C. With the assistance of these gases, waste LiCoO2 2 can be reduced and transformed to water-soluble Li2CO3 2 CO 3 and water-insoluble CoO/Co. A high Li recovery rate of 98.5 % is achieved after a 5-min roasting process at 500 degrees C in a closed reactor. The optimal mass ratio of TPT back sheet to LiCoO2 2 is closed to 1: 1.

We analyze impulse responses using local projections and identify UMP shocks through high-frequency identification strategy. We show that forward guidance (FG) and large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) shocks lead to distinct responses when analyzing commodity prices. We find that asset-like commodities, such as gold and silver, respond to these UMP shocks most aggressively. While an easing FG shock leads to increases in their prices, an easing LSAP shock has the opposite effect. This differential response suggests that these asset-like commodities are being used as inflation and exchange rate hedges. In contrast, production-like and agricultural commodities respond to UMP shocks in the same way as conventional monetary policy shocks. Consistent with previous literature, we find that easing LSAP shocks, to some extent, signal a negative economic outlook. Policymakers can exploit the responses from the various commodity classes examined in this paper when evaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy in different sectors of the economy.","[Yao, Wenying] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Rafiq, Shuddhasattwa] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",University of Melbourne; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Deakin University,"Yao, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",pedro.gomisporqueras@qut.edu.au; srafiq@deakin.edu.au; W.Yao@mbs.edu,"Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/AAS-6934-2020","Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/0000-0002-3637-9142",,,,,45,1,1,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The exploitation and application of new antibacterial agents is extremely urgent. As a natural biopolymer, cellulose has recently attracted much attention due to its excellent hydrophilicity, economy, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In particular, the preparation of cellulose-based hydrogels with excellent structure and properties from cellulose and its derivatives has received increasing attention thanks to the existence of abundant hydrophilic functional groups (such as hydroxyl, carboxy, and aldehyde groups) within cellulose and its derivatives. The cellulose-based hydrogels have broad application prospects in antibacterial-related biomedical fields.

For a variety of physical, social and psychological reasons, older adults are likely to confront a variety of nutritional problems and actively seek dietary solutions through the purchase of appropriate products. The elderly is also too often a group most susceptible to many health risks from a nutrient poor diet. An evaluation of a group of 96 elderly Romanian people concerning eating behaviour and their preference was made. This was correlated with elderly health status and their request concerning food. 22% of the elderly people have a malnutrition major risk. There are a wide range of reasons why older individuals might not be eating the most nutritious diet. The food and drink industry must thus produce innovative foods high in nutrients, convenient in price, which, in combination with a healthy life style and compliance with advice for healthy ageing will improve the quality of life and add life to years.","[Duta, D.; Belc, N.] Inst Food Bioresources, Bucharest 2, Romania; [Lupeanu, E.] Ana Aslan Natl Inst Gerontol & Geriatr, Bucharest 1, Romania; [Cucu, N.] Univ Bucharest, Fac Biol, Bucharest 5, Romania",National Research & Development Institute for Food Bioresources - IBA Bucharest; National Institute of Gerontology & Geriatrics Ana Aslan; University of Bucharest,"Duta, D (通讯作者)，Inst Food Bioresources, 6 Dinu Vintila St, Bucharest 2, Romania.",denisa.duta@bioresurse.ro,"Nastasia, Belc/KHY-3258-2024; Cucu, Natalia/AAQ-3429-2020; DUTA, Denisa/C-7057-2017","DUTA, Denisa/0000-0002-8821-7268; Cucu, Natalia/0000-0001-9961-8414",,,,,10,2,2,0,8,SCIBULCOM LTD,SOFIA,"PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA",1311-5065,,,J ENVIRON PROT ECOL,J.

Furthermore, well-established, advanced, and emerging countries are seeking fossil fuel and petroleum resources to support their aviation, electric utilities, industrial sectors, and consumer processing essentials. There is an increasing tendency to overcome these challenging concerns and achieve the Paris Agreement's priorities as emerging technological advances in clean energy technologies progress. Hydrogen is expected to be implemented in various production applications as a fundamental fuel in future energy carrier materials development and manufacturing processes. This paper summarizes recent developments and hydrogen technologies in fuel refining, hydrocarbon processing, materials manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, aircraft construction, electronics, and other hydrogen applications. It also highlights the existing industrialization scenario and describes prospective innovations, including theoretical scientific advancements, green raw materials production, potential exploration, and renewable resource integration. Moreover, this article further discusses some socioeconomic implications of hydrogen as a green resource.","[Qazi, Umair Yaqub] Univ Hafr Al Batin, Dept Chem, Coll Sci, POB 1803, Hafar al Batin 39524, Saudi Arabia",Hafr Albatin University,"Qazi, UY (通讯作者)，Univ Hafr Al Batin, Dept Chem, Coll Sci, POB 1803, Hafar al Batin 39524, Saudi Arabia.",umairqazi@uhb.edu.sa,"Qazi, Umair Yaqub/W-1999-2017","Qazi, Umair Yaqub/0000-0002-7597-1771","Ministry of Education; University of Hafr Al Batin, Saudi Arabia; [IFP-A-2022-2-4-14]","Ministry of Education; University of Hafr Al Batin, Saudi Arabia;","This research work was funded by institutional fund projects under no (IFP-A-2022-2-4-14).

Among the most demanding microalgae at industrial level, diatoms and Haematococcus pluvialis have hooked the race. However, they at the same time face difficulty in their cell wall disruption for the VAB to come out as it is very rigid and thick. This is among the major barrier in construction of diatom solar panels for biofuel production. Different diatom walls experience different shear forces for harvesting its biomass. This results in raising the overall cost of photobioreactors controlling their growth and recovery of biomass and VAB. In order to lower the cost, the cell wall of microalgae needs to milk the metabolites without itself getting sacrificed. The current review in depth discusses the techniques to break the cell wall of microalgae especially diatoms and Haematococcus using nanotechnological approaches without lysing the cell. The research gaps, commercial applications, and future research directions have been identified and discussed to strengthen the environmental and economical sustainability.","[Ahirwar, Ankesh; Meignen, Gurvan; Khan, Mohd.

Here, we propose a physicochemical concept - called {2-phases 2-reactions 1-catalyst} - to perform two chemical reactions simultaneously with only one catalyst using a liquid-liquid biphasic system. The well-known and commercially available alpha-Keggin polyoxometalate (POM), PW12O403-, was used as a photocatalyst for oxidizing a hydrophobic compound in an organic phase. The reduced POM, PW12O404-, being more hydrophilic, diffuses then in the aqueous phase where it reduces a hydrophilic compound. After this step, the re-oxidized POM migrates back to the organic phase closing the catalytic cycle. We applied this concept to several basic reactions: oxidations of organic compounds (e.g. alcohol to aldehyde), degradation of organic dyes, metal recovery by reduction of metal ions, and in situ metal-organic complexation reactions. This concept is proposed as a powerful, simple and sustainable tool to couple diverse photo-oxidation/reduction reactions. As an example, oxidative dye degradation/metal (silver) recovery were performed using this general methodology. The main advantage of the {2-phases 2-reactions 1-catalyst} concept is the economy of one reactor and one catalyst, including its self-regeneration by another useful reaction.","[Schmid, Philipp; Jost, Gasper; Grass, Xaver; Pfitzner, Arno] Univ Regensburg, Inst Inorgan Chem, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Touraud, Didier] Univ Regensburg, Inst Phys & Theoret Chem, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Diat, Olivier; Bauduin, Pierre] Univ Montpellier, ICSM, ENSCM, CNRS,CEA, Marcoule, France",University of Regensburg; University of Regensburg; Universite de Montpellier; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bauduin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, ICSM, ENSCM, CNRS,CEA, Marcoule, France.",pierre.bauduin@cea.fr,"Bauduin, Pierre/AAV-3936-2020; diat, olivier/B-5985-2016; Pfitzner, Arno/E-7568-2012","Bauduin, Pierre/0000-0001-6128-7971; Pfitzner, Arno/0000-0001-8653-7439",,,,,86,4,4,0,35,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,MAR 21,2022,24,6,,,,,2516,2526,,10.1039/d1gc04265c,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc04265c,,FEB 2022,11,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,ZW2JB,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000761930200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bimetallic catalysts offer the variation of different properties, enabling the design of tailor-made catalysts. The combination of silver and palladium, both highly active for specific liquid-phase oxidation reactions, shows promise for superior performance in the selective oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to FDCA. While Ag/CBA and Ag3Pd1/CBA, supported on carbon black acetylene (CBA), were active only for the oxidation of the aldehyde group of HMF, increasing the Pd-fraction allowed for the oxidation of the alcohol group as well. In-depth characterization by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a synergistic effect between Ag and Pd in Pd-rich alloys, leading to an enhanced performance. Pd is particularly effective in activating oxygen, the oxidizing agent, while Ag ensures a high selectivity in the dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, removing residual surfactants from the synthesized catalysts by increasing the calcination temperature further enhanced the activity. This study demonstrates the potential of tuning the catalytic properties of noble metal-based catalysts for optimizing liquid-phase oxidation reactions.","[Neukum, Dominik; Ludwig, Maya Eyleen; Uzunidis, Georgios; Behrens, Silke; Grunwaldt, Jan-Dierk; Saraci, Erisa] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Catalysis Res & Technol, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Neukum, Dominik; Grunwaldt, Jan-Dierk; Saraci, Erisa] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Chem Technol & Polymer Chem, Engesserstr 20, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Lakshmi Nilayam, Ajai Raj] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Nanotechnol, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Lakshmi Nilayam, Ajai Raj] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe Nano Micro Facil KNMFi, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Krause, Baerbel] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Photon Sci & Synchrotron Radiat, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Grunwaldt, JD; Saraçi, E (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Catalysis Res & Technol, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.;Grunwaldt, JD; Saraçi, E (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Chem Technol & Polymer Chem, Engesserstr 20, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.",grunwaldt@kit.edu,"Saraçi, Erisa/AAI-5368-2020; Saraci, Erisa/N-1873-2017; Behrens, Silke/R-8066-2018; Grunwaldt, Jan-Dierk/L-9246-2013","Saraci, Erisa/0000-0001-6770-5986; Behrens, Silke/0000-0003-4328-9564; Krause, Baerbel/0000-0001-6288-0283; Grunwaldt, Jan-Dierk/0000-0003-3606-0956","Bundesministerium fr Ernhrung und Landwirtschaft; Helmholtz Research Infrastructure at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) [22010718, 460248799]; Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the FNR",Bundesministerium fr Ernhrung und Landwirtschaft; Helmholtz Research Infrastructure at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT); Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) through the FNR,"The authors would like to thank Veronika Holderied for assistance in HPLC analysis and Armin Lautenbach for ICP-OES analysis.

The potential sources of microfiber pollution are analyzed from the supply chain of the textile and fashion industry. Additionally, actionable solutions, including a shift in consumer behavior, retailer recycling programs, and government behavior in the development of a sustainable economy and environment protection for textile and fashion industry, are proposed.

Unlike conventional methods featuring extensive chemicals or energy consumption, membrane separation technology plays a crucial role in facilitating the sustainable and efficient recovery of valuable metals from wastewater due to its attractive features. In this review, we first briefly summarize the sustainable supply chain and significance of sustainable recovery of aqueous high-value metals. Then, we review the most recent advances and application potential in promising state-of-the-art membranebased technologies for recovery of high-value metals (silver, gold, rhenium, platinum, ruthenium, palladium, iridium, osmium, and rhodium) from wastewater effluents. In particular, pressure-based membranes, liquid membranes, membrane distillation, forward osmosis, electrodialysis and membrane-based hybrid technologies and their mechanism of high-value metal recovery is thoroughly discussed. Then, engineering application and economic sustainability are also discussed for membrane-based high-value metal recovery. The review finally concludes with a critical and insightful overview of the techno-economic viability and future research direction of membrane technologies for efficient high-value metal recovery from wastewater.","[Gebreslassie, Gebrehiwot; Desta, Halefom G.; Lin, Bin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Yingchao] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiangyong; Zhao, Min] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Gebreslassie, Gebrehiwot] Addis Ababa Sci & Technol Univ, Coll Nat & Appl Sci, Dept Ind Chem, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; Wenzhou University; Addis Ababa University","Lin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Dong, YC (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, XY; Zhao, M (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Wenzhou, Peoples R China.",ycdong@cuhk.edu.cn; x.zheng@wzu.edu.cn; zmcnzj@sina.com; bin@uestc.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiangyong/JZD-9716-2024; Gebreslassie, Gebrehiwot/ISV-0994-2023; Lin, Bin/C-5933-2011","Dong, Yingchao/0000-0003-1409-0994; Gebreslassie, Gebrehiwot/0000-0001-6790-2744; Lin, Bin/0000-0002-4099-309X","Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2023YFG0202]; Foundation of Yangtze Delta Region Institute (Huzhou) of UESTC, China [U04210055]; NSFC-RGC Joint Program [52261160381]; NSFC General Program [52070033]; National Natural Science Foundation of China","Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province; Foundation of Yangtze Delta Region Institute (Huzhou) of UESTC, China; NSFC-RGC Joint Program; NSFC General Program(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2023YFG0202) , the Foundation of Yangtze Delta Region Institute (Huzhou) of UESTC, China (U04210055) , the NSFC-RGC Joint Program (52261160381) and NSFC General Program (52070033) of National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,305,6,6,61,111,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0043-1354,1879-2448,,WATER RES,Water Res.,NOV 1,2024,265,,,,,,,,122122,10.1016/j.watres.2024.122122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.122122,,AUG 2024,31,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,D2M4I,39128331,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001294577300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We ask the question whether this unique feature of carbon dioxide removal technologies fundamentally alters the dynamics of climate mitigation pathways. The analysis is performed in the coupled energy-economy-climate model ReMIND using the bioenergy with CCS route as an application of CDR technology. BECCS is arguably the least cost CDR option if biomass availability is not a strongly limiting factor. We compare mitigation pathways with and without BECCS to explore the impact of CDR technologies on the mitigation portfolio. Effects are most pronounced for stringent climate policies where BECCS is a key technology for the effectiveness of carbon pricing policies. The decoupling of emissions and emissions control allows prolonging the use of fossil fuels in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, particularly in the transport sector. It also balances the distribution of mitigation costs across future generations. CDR is not a silver bullet technology. The largest part of emissions reductions continues to be provided by direct mitigation measures at the emissions source. The value of CDR lies in its flexibility to alleviate the most costly constraints on mitigating emissions.","[Kriegler, Elmar; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Reuster, Lena; Luderer, Gunnar; Klein, David] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Kriegler, E (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",kriegler@pik-potsdam.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013; Kriegler, Elmar/I-3048-2016; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Kriegler, Elmar/0000-0002-3307-2647; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155",,,,,29,97,105,2,89,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

An emerging solution for the above problem is the development of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their mimics as alternative disinfectants in agriculture and aquaculture. These antibacterial agents usually exhibit excellent potency and a low drug resistance generation rate, but are highly cytotoxic to eukaryotes and thus post safety concerns. Here, we report our solution to this problem by introducing degradable linkers in oligoguanidine-based antimicrobial peptidomimetics with a dual-selective mechanism of action. With both bacterial membrane and DNA targeting capability, the hit peptidomimetic exhibited higher therapeutic indices and synergistic effects with other antibiotics, while its fast antimicrobial kinetics and low resistance rate were maintained. In addition, the added degradable feature improved the biocompatibility and environmental sustainability of this material. The oligoguanidine-based hit peptidomimetic also showed good activity in vivo, as it did not cause observable toxicity in zebrafish, and it could significantly improve the survival rate of zebrafish in a scratch wound infection model.","[Huang, Guopu; Chen, Xianhui; Wu, Tong; Chen, Zhiyong; Chen, Yajie; Song, Junfeng; Cai, Qingyun; Bai, Yugang; Feng, Xinxin] Hunan Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Chem Biosensing & Chemometr, Hunan Prov Key Lab Biomacromol Chem Biol, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Hui] Zhongnan Hosp Wuhan Univ, Dept Hematol, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Pu, Huangsheng] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Wuhan University; National University of Defense Technology - China,"Cai, QY; Bai, YG; Feng, XX (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Chem Biosensing & Chemometr, Hunan Prov Key Lab Biomacromol Chem Biol, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Pu, HS (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China.",qycai0001@hnu.edu.cn; baiyugang@hnu.edu.cn; phs@nudt.edu.cn; xinxin_feng@hnu.edu.cn,"song, junfeng/JSL-3362-2023; Wu, Tong/KLZ-8636-2024; Feng, Xinixn/HPD-6503-2023","Huang, Guopu/0009-0001-9074-6361; Huang, Guopu/0009-0005-8927-3826; Bai, Yugang/0000-0002-9834-7517; Cai, Qianyun/0000-0002-6006-7886","Hunan University, as a part of China's Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21877033, 92163127, 21807031, 22177031]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ30088, 2020JJ4177]; Advanced Interdisciplinary Program of the College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies [JC18-03]","Hunan University, as a part of China's Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Advanced Interdisciplinary Program of the College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies","This research was made possible as a result of the start-up funding from Hunan University, as a part of China's Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21877033, 92163127, Y.

The ideas of reconquering America, civilizing the indigenous population, and fostering the economy, especially minig activities, in older to increase fiscal revenue permeate the mind of political authorities. In this context, arose all interest in the silver mine of Huantajaya located on the coast of Tarapaca. This mine was well-known for its wealth but did not yield the expected results. Hence, the political authorities needed to obtain reliable information about it and how production could be improved. This was Antonio O'Brien's mission. whose biographical delta together with references from his intellectual legacy-manuscripts, maps, and plans-are given here. Today, such data and references constitute indispensable sources for the study of the province of Tarapaca in the XVIII century.

Notably, the frequency of certain cancers (including lung cancer), increases significantly with the age of patients and there is now a wealth of data showing that multiple mechanisms leading to malignant transformation and to aging are interconnected, defining the so-called common biology of aging and cancer. OncoAge, a consortium launched in 2015, brings together the multidisciplinary expertise of leading public hospital services and academic laboratories to foster the transfer of scientific knowledge rapidly acquired in the fields of cancer biology and aging into innovative medical practice and silver economy development. This is achieved through the development of shared technical platforms (for research on genome stability, (epi)genetics, biobanking, immunology, metabolism, and artificial intelligence), clinical research projects, clinical trials, and education. OncoAge focuses mainly on two pilot pathologies, which benefit from the expertise of several members, namely lung and head and neck cancers. This review outlines the broad strategic directions and key advances of OncoAge and summarizes some of the issues faced by this consortium, as well as the short- and long-term perspectives.","[Hofman, Paul;

Among these strategies, zero-dimensional nanomaterials (0D NMs) have emerged as highly promising candidates for the removal of p-NP due to their high surface area, tunable physicochemical properties, and versatile functionalization capabilities. This comprehensive review examines green synthesis methods for 0D NMs, utilizing various waste materials, in alignment with the principles of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and circular economy. The mechanistic pathways that contribute to the efficacy of different 0D NMs in p-NP remediation were systematically investigate. By critically analyzing the extant literature, the key factors influencing the catalytic activity of these nano- materials, such as surface morphology, electronic structure, and functional group interactions systematically were also investigated. Additionally, the current challenges and potential future directions for the large-scale application of 0D NMs in environmental remediation were also discussed.

The accumulating RE magnet waste in the form of end-of-life products (EoL), criticality of supply-demand, and the huge environmental costs associated with RE mining translated into an increased focus on RE recycling processes in the last decade. Environmentally friendly pyrometallurgical techniques were developed as an alternative to the traditional hydrometallurgical route due to the generation of large amounts of waste in hydrometallurgy. Liquid metal extraction (LME) is a promising pyrometallurgical technology as it has the ability to handle a wide variety of scrap feed materials, from swarf to ingots; to produce clean material with minimal impurities; and to allow the separation of metallic species without metallothermic reduction. So far, magnesium, silver, copper, and bismuth have been used as LME agents while exploration of other possibilities is ongoing. This article presents a systematic review of previous studies on the extraction agents in terms of the reaction mechanisms, behavior of the RE elements, extraction efficiencies, and the formation of intermetallic compounds during the process.","[Rasheed, Mohammad Zarar; Kim, Bum-Sung; Kim, Taek-Soo] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Technol, Daejeon, South Korea; [Nam, Sun-Woo; Cho, Ju-Young; Park, Kyoung-Tae] Korea Inst Ind Technol, Korea Inst Rare Met, Incheon, South Korea",University of Science & Technology (UST); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH),"Kim, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Technol, Daejeon, South Korea.",tskim@kitech.re.kr,"Kwon, Soon-Yong/F-4744-2010; Cho, Jae/AAW-7137-2020; Kim, Sooyeon/AAA-8521-2022","Kim, Bum Sung/0000-0002-6250-0233",,,,,75,13,14,2,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1073-5615,1543-1916,,METALL MATER TRANS B,Metall.

Off-grid solar (OGS) power generation systems are a widely studied case for accelerating energy transitions for the global poor. While OGS is often analyzed at national or subnational levels, little is known about the role of global production networks (GPNs) in scaling energy access in the Global South. The present study addresses this research gap by applying a neoGramscian approach to examine interactions between GPNs and national regulatory frameworks by considering cases in the Indian and Kenyan OGS sector. Employing a comparative research design, 39 qualitative expert interviews were conducted in Hong Kong, New Delhi, and Nairobi. The study identifies two different avenues taken by coalitions of public and private stakeholders to embed GPNs in the Indian and Kenyan OGS markets. In India, a competitive approach was found to governing GPNs, whereas a distribution of labor was predominant in Kenya. Future research should further investigate how and why GPNs become part of energy transitions in the Global South to stabilize assumptions regarding the future of energy systems.","[Galan, Matthias] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Welthandelspl 1,D5,Level 3, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Galan, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Welthandelspl 1,D5,Level 3, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",matthias.galan@gmail.com,"Galan, Matthias/HNJ-0702-2023","Galan, Matthias/0000-0001-6195-0286",,,,,97,6,6,1,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

King Carlos III created this new viceroyalty by detaching territories from the Viceroyalty of Peru, incorporating the Potosi silver mines, and opening the port of Buenos Aires following the 1778 Regulation of Free Trade between Spain and its colonies. The previously marginal Rio de la Plata region gained significance, a development that led to the establishment of the Consulate of Commerce of Buenos Aires in 1794. In 1808, the Spanish monarchy was replaced by Napoleon's brother, Jos & eacute; I Bonaparte; the Spanish king was now a prisoner of the French. The turmoil triggered within Spain itself the Spanish War of Independence-independence from France, that is. But a parallel movement occurred in America, sparking debates about the locus of legitimate authority, even if the colonies were not yet proposing to break from Spain. Should power reside with the Regency Council or revert to the local populace? On May 25, 1810, the Cabildo Abierto de Buenos Aires, a town council, argued that sovereignty reverted to the people, and it deposed Viceroy Baltazar Hidalgo de Cisneros. The move led to the formation of the First Junta, which would hold royal power until Ferdinand VII's return to the Spanish throne in 1813. Fernando VII's annulment of the 1812 Constitution of Cadiz and the pro-monarchist stance of the 1815 Congress of Vienna signaled resistance to revolutionary changes in American territories. But colonists responded, issuing their Declaration of Independence from Spain on July 9, 1816. In 1816, most of the region's economy was largely based on livestock with low levels of value added. Silver mines in Potosi, still a source of income today for Argentina, were lost in 1810 when the region was lost. After independence, Argentina suffered a lack of investment in infrastructure, to keep roads and ports in usable conditions, limiting the economy's potential. The country suffered from a limited labor force, unprotected property rights, and armed conflicts. The economy saw a few changes between 1810 and 1830, such as the addition of sheep and salting houses, but not much transpired until the implementation of the classical liberal project during mid-1850s. Post-independence, Argentina faced numerous challenges in consolidating its territories and resolving key issues, such as the ownership of customs revenues and the choice of a national capital. Buenos Aires, the wealthiest province, resisted ceding control of its port city to the other provinces or a federal government. Another major debate was the form of government-constitutional monarchy, confederate state, unitary republic, or federal republic. The need to think about the form of government was, in part, what allowed a group of classical liberal thinkers to influence the discussions about the future of the country. In the early 1820s, the newly named United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata experienced civil wars over governance and the fate of Buenos Aires's customs revenue. Initially dominated by the faction favoring a unitary republic led by Bernardino Rivadavia, and later dominated by the federal faction under Juan Manuel de Rosas, Buenos Aires represented contrasting visions: Rivadavia's Enlightenment-inspired liberal reforms versus Rosas's conservative and reactionary policies. Despite setbacks, Enlightenment liberalism gradually took root, especially through figures like Manuel Belgrano and Mariano Moreno, and later through the influential Generation of '37. The defeat of Rosas at the Battle of Caseros in 1852 paved the way for the 1853 Constitution, embodying Juan Bautista Alberdi's liberal ideas. In this article we proceed into the aftermath of the 1853 Constitution, with the intention of picking up the story around 1884, the year of Alberdi's death, in an article to follow.3 3","[Gomez, Alejandro] Univ CEMA, Econ Hist, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cachanosky, Nicolas] Univ Texas El Paso, Ctr Free Enterprise, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Gómez, A (通讯作者)，Univ CEMA, Econ Hist, RA-1054 Buenos Aires, Argentina.",agomez@ufm.edu; ncachanosky@utep.edu,"Cachanosky, Nicolas/C-4488-2014",,,,,,20,1,1,0,0,INST SPONTANEOUS ORDER ECONOMICS,FAIRFAX,"9745 KINGS CROWN COURT #102, FAIRFAX, VA 22031 USA",1933-527X,,,ECON J WATCH,Econ.

Conversion of Bavarian Norway spruce stands under the present climate scenario was simulated using the individual tree simulator SILVA. Three conversion strategies initiated at two different stand ages, 30 and 60 years, were simulated to develop uneven-aged mixed stands of Norway spruce, silver fir and European beech: gap creation, shelterwood and passive conversion. The three conversion strategies were furthermore combined with different harvesting rates. These conversion scenarios were compared with maintaining the even-aged Norway spruce management as reference. Scenarios were evaluated in terms of mean annual increment and structural development over a 150-year conversion period as well as the expectation value (EV) for eternal future rotations. Compared to the reference scenario, conversion scenarios reduced mean annual increment (6-43%) and also generally EV (-5-78%), except for some scenarios when stand age at conversion was 60 and applying a 3% discount rate. Conversion by shelterwood always reduced EV (both compared to the reference and other conversion scenarios) when initiated at age 30. With passive conversion, the effect on EV was dependent on the assumptions regarding regeneration costs. Gap conversion generally resulted in high EV and increased stand heterogeneity fastest among the different strategies. Other scenarios, especially passive conversion, were dependent on heavy thinning for developing heterogeneity faster (although still slower than with creation of gaps). Most conversion scenarios eventually resulted in similar structural heterogeneity, but the time it took to get to this stage varied greatly (50-120 years). Conversion by creation of smaller gaps in combination with a high rate of target diameter harvesting resulted in a favorable conversion in terms of economic returns and development of stand heterogeneity due to early income and differentiated regeneration.","[Reventlow, D.

To limit the usage of non-reusable components and the amount of garbage that must be transferred at the end of a product's life cycle, longer-lasting electrical domestic appliances are a pillar of the circular economy. In recent years, the complexity of printed circuit boards (PCBs) used in the manufacture of modern electrical devices has increased, leading to an increase in device failures. This study focuses on the maintenance and recycling of domestic electrical appliance components and printed circuit boards. The proposed methodology for PCB repair is defined as a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) problem implemented in MATLAB environment and successfully tested to a variety of domestic appliances such as refrigerator, dishwasher and washing machine. The possibility of recycling metal parts of electronic components, which were replaced after PCBs' repair was also studied. Metals' percentage concentration of PCB electronic components for three customer's budgets considering metals and valuable metals recovery as given from the corresponding average metal recovery and calculated from different recycling procedures presented in the literature. The results of the proposed procedure in terms of valuable metals gave 38.4078 ppm of silver. We also compared the suggested procedure with other works in terms of environmental perspective considering four measures, namely the gross energy requirement (GER), the global warming potential (GWP), the acidification potential (AP), and the solid waste burden (SWB). In terms of economic perspective and considering the existence of silver (Ag) in the electronic components, the recommended method gave comparable amount of money. Finally, a comparison of different recycling works from a technical viewpoint is also conducted. Moreover, a reparability index of domestic electrical appliances is introduced to further quantify the results of the proposed algorithm.","[Karagiannopoulos, Panagiotis S.; Manousakis, Nikolaos M.; Psomopoulos, Constantinos S.] Univ West Attica, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Thivon & P Ralli Str 250, Athens 12244, Greece",University of West Attica,"Karagiannopoulos, PS (通讯作者)，Univ West Attica, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Thivon & P Ralli Str 250, Athens 12244, Greece.",p.karagian@uniwa.gr; manousakis_n@uniwa.gr; cpsomop@uniwa.gr,"Manousakis, Nikolaos/AAP-4398-2021; Psomopoulos, Constantinos/E-7277-2010","Karagiannopoulos, Panagiotis/0000-0002-0694-1819",,,,,67,4,4,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

However, the quick achievement of these benefits is closely related to the value of the OGD, i.e., how useful, and reusable the data provided by public agencies are for creating value for the above stakeholder. This is where the notion of high-value datasets (HVD), defined by the European Commission in Open Data Directive, comes, referring to data that can create the most value for society, the economy, and the environment. This is even more so, considering the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in various domains. While there are some efforts in that direction, there is still no available framework for identifying country-specific high-value datasets (and their determinants). The objective of the workshop is to raise awareness and build a network of key stake-holders around the HVD issue, to allow each participant to think about how and whether the determination of HVD is taking place in their country, how this can be improved with the help of portal owners, data publishers, data owners, businesses and citizens, what are and can be determinants to be used for identifying HVDs, whether they are SMART.

Considering the potential of organic waste and residue streams to be transformed into valuable products, much effort is now being directed to foster circular bio-economy strategies. The valorisation of organic waste reduces the pressure on non-renewable resources and avoids the generation of waste. Organic waste valorisation has attracted much attention from fundamental and applied fields, given its wide availability and versatility. This review aims to provide an insight into valorisation of organic waste of aquatic, agricultural, forestry and animal origin to polymeric matrices, bionanoparticles and their combination. An introductory analysis dealing with state-of-the-art circular bioeconomy, recycling and upcycling is provided. Then, a literature review in the context of biopolymers and derived nanoparticles is provided, emphasizing toxicity and biodegradability aspects. The environmental impacts of valorisation processes are analyzed according to life cycle assessment.

The enormously rising environmental changes, industrialization, and genetic modification have further exacerbated skin cancer statistics. Current treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are facing several issues related to cost, toxicity, and bioavailability thereby leading to declined anti-skin cancer therapeutic efficacy and poor patient compliance. In the context of overcoming this limitation, several nanotechnological advancements have been witnessed so far. Among various nanomaterials, nanoparticles have endowed exorbitant advantages by acting as both therapeutic agents and drug carriers for the remarkable treatment of skin cancer. The small size and large surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles escalate the skin tumor uptake through their leaky vasculature resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In this context, the present review provides up to date information about different types and pathology of skin cancer, followed by their current treatment modalities and associated drawbacks. Furthermore, it meticulously discusses the role of numerous inorganic, polymer, and lipid-based nanoparticles in skin cancer therapy with subsequent descriptions of their patents and clinical trials.","[Zeng, Leli; Zhang, Changhua; Li, Jia] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 7, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Digest Canc Res, Digest Dis Ctr, Shenzhen 518107, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gowda, B.

However, this causes the production of million tons of relevant wastes, i.e., plastic cups, aluminum capsules, coffee chaff (silver skin), and spent coffee grounds (SCG), all thrown untreated into landfills. It is estimated that 1kg of instant coffee generates around 2kg of wet SCG; a relatively unique organic waste stream, with little to no contamination, separated directly in the source by the coffee shops. The produced waste has been under researchers' microscope as a useful feedstock for a number of promising applications. SCG is considered a valuable, nutrients rich source of bioactive compounds (e.g., phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids, lipids, chlorogenic and protocatechuic acid, melanoidins, diterpenes, xanthines, vitamin precursors, etc.) and a useful resource material in other processes (e.g., soil improver and compost, heavy metals absorbent, biochar, biodiesel, pellets, cosmetics, food, and deodorization products). This paper aims to provide a holistic approach for the SCG waste management, highlighting a series of processes and applications in environmental solutions, food industry, and agricultural sector.

These precipitates also co-precipitate unrecovered valuable metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Ag) as well as elements of concern (As, Cd, Hg). After stabilization, the residues are traditionally landfilled. This work investigates pyrometallurgical treatment of jarosite residue to convert the material into reusable clean slag and to recover the valuable metals within the residue. The pyrometallurgical treatment is divided into two functional steps. First, the material is melted in an oxidizing atmosphere, after which the oxide melt is reduced to produce an inert, clean slag. Then, a liquid metal or speiss phase collects the valuable metals, such as silver. The aim was to examine the optimal process conditions for reaching the target values for remaining metals in the slag; Pb < 0.03 wt %, Zn < 1 wt %. As a conclusion, the limiting factor in sulfur, lead, and zinc removal is the contact between the oxidizing or reducing gas and the molten sample. The mass transfer and volatile metals removal were significantly improved with a gas lance installation. The improved gas-liquid interaction enabled the first steps of gas flow rate optimization and ensured the sufficiently low end-concentrations of the aforementioned elements.","[Rama, Minna; Nurmi, Samu; Jokilaakso, Ari; Klemettinen, Lassi; Taskinen, Pekka] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Kemistintie 1,POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Salminen, Justin] Boliden Kokkola Oy, POB 26, Kokkola 67101, Finland",Aalto University,"Rämä, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Kemistintie 1,POB 16100, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland.",minna.rama@aalto.fi; samu.nurmi@aalto.fi; ari.jokilaakso@aalto.fi; lassi.klemettinen@aalto.fi; pekka.taskinen@aalto.fi; justin.salminen@boliden.com,"Klemettinen, Lassi/AAA-4936-2020; Jokilaakso, Ari/M-7223-2016; Taskinen, Pekka/K-4292-2015","Rama, Minna/0000-0002-0774-1886; Jokilaakso, Ari/0000-0003-0582-7181; Taskinen, Pekka/0000-0002-4054-952X; Klemettinen, Lassi/0000-0001-9633-7131",Tekes,Tekes(Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES)),Financial support for this study is provided by Tekes nationally funded CMEco project.,,23,37,39,2,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2075-4701,,,METALS-BASEL,Metals,OCT,2018,8,10,,,,,,,744,10.3390/met8100744,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met8100744,,,9,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,GY5XZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000448658700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The generated wastes have been accumulated over the years in tailings dams or in piles. These materials represent wasted from old circuits, as well as from plants still in production. In this study, geochemical, mineralogical, 3D modelling, and metallurgical analyses wastes were carried out to evaluate potential reuse of these wastes. The performed characterization detected residues of very fine grain size containing sulfides and oxides. The wastes show high grades of Au hosted in different minerals. In addition to Au, samples contain S, Fe, Zn, Pb, Sc, Si, and As. The 3D modelling for spatial definition of Au was performed using ordinary kriging with dimensional variograms. The results indicated the occurrence of Au enrichment zones and allowed to reveal the most attractive tailing deposits in terms of Au content. Metallurgical tests showed recovery of 70% of Au and suggested other potential reuse of the wastes, such as aggregates for the civil construction sector and recovery of other metals. The present work highlights the importance of an integrative characterization within the scope of the circular economy and the value of tailings in the production chain of the mineral sector.","[Lemos, Mariana; Valente, Teresa; Reis, Paula Marinho] Pole Univ Minho, Inst Earth Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Lemos, Mariana; Pantaleao, Joao Paulo; Guabiroba, Fernanda; Gregorio Filho, Jose; Magalhaes, Marcus; Afonseca, Bruno; Silva, Antonio Roberto] Anglogold Ashanti, BR-34000000 Nova Lima, Brazil; [Fonseca, Rita] Univ Evora, Pole Univ Evora, Inst Earth Sci, P-7000 Evora, Portugal; [Delbem, Itamar] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Microscopy Ctr, BR-31270013 Belo Horizonte, Brazil",University of Evora; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Lemos, M (通讯作者)，Pole Univ Minho, Inst Earth Sci, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Lemos, M (通讯作者)，Anglogold Ashanti, BR-34000000 Nova Lima, Brazil.",id8548@alunos.uminho.pt,"; Valente, Antonio/G-6231-2012; Reis, Amelia/I-1514-2013; Valente, Teresa/M-4688-2013","Fonseca, Rita/0000-0002-6389-2822; Valente, Antonio/0000-0002-5798-1298; Reis, Amelia/0000-0003-0922-8290; Gazire Lemos, mariana/0000-0002-9629-3332; Valente, Teresa/0000-0002-7293-3825","FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia and Tecnologia [UIDB/04683/2020, UIDP/04683/2020, Nano-MINENV 029259 (PTDC/CTA-AMB/29259/2017)]",FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia and Tecnologia,"We thank our colleagues from the ICT, microscopy center from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CM-UFMG), and AngloGold Ashanti who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted the research.

Currently, the homopolysaccharide (HoPS) structure of a novel lactic acid bacterium (LAB) is under study, as well as its application as a green corrosion inhibitor. Weissella cibaria FMy 2-21-1 is a LAB strain capable of producing HoPS in sucrose enriched media. The isolated and purified HoPS was characterized by different spectroscopic analyses as a linear alpha-1,6 dextran adopting a random coil conformation, with high molecular weight and extended size in water. The polysaccharide showed a semi-crystalline organization, which is a requirement for film formation. Its biocoating showed a grainy network structure, with a slightly lesser hydrophobic role in the aqueous environment than in the ionic one. The electrochemical measurements of the steel-HoPS coating showed that the biopolymer layer acts as an anodic-type corrosion inhibitor, with high resistance to corrosion by water and with chloride ions which prevent pitting, a corrosion process typical of bare steel. Few reports have cited the application of LAB HoPS as corrosive coating inhibitors. This work is the first to explore the influence of a structurally characterized dextran from Weissella cibaria strain as a potential steel corrosion inhibitor in ionic environments.","[Emanuel Lobo, Rene; Font de Valdez, Graciela; Ines Torino, Maria] Ctr Referencia Lactobacilos CERELA CCT CONICET NO, Batalla de Chacabuco 145, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Andres Orrillo, Patricio; Beatriz Ribotta, Susana] UNT, Fac Bioquim Quim & Farm, Inst Quim Fis, Inst Quim Noroeste Argentino INQUINOA Univ Nacl T, Batalla de Ayacucho 471, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina; [Santos Garcia, Mercedes; Rodriguez Cabello, Jose Carlos] Univ Valladolid, CIBER BBN, BIOFORGE Grp Adv Mat & Nanobiotechnol, Valladolid 47011, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Universidad de Valladolid; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERBBN,"Torino, MI (通讯作者)，Ctr Referencia Lactobacilos CERELA, Batalla de Chacabuco 145, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina.",elobo@cerela.org.ar; patricio.orrillo@fbqf.unt.edu.ar; susana.ribotta@fbqf.unt.edu.ar; gfont@cerela.org.ar; msantos@bioforge.uva.es; roca@bioforge.uva.es; mitorino@cerela.org.ar,"Rodríguez-Cabello, José/G-6555-2017; Santos, Mercedes/D-5243-2016; Lobo, Rene/AAY-3485-2020",,"(ANPCyT-FONCyT, Argentina) [PICT 1705]; (Spanish Government) [PID2019-110709RB-100, RTI2018-096320-B-C22, RED2018-102417-T]; (Interreg V Espan?a Portugal POCTEP) [VA317P18, Infrared2018-UVA06]; (Junta de Castilla y Leon) [PICT 1705, PID2019-110709RB-100]; (Interreg V Espana Portugal POCTEP) [RTI2018-096320-B-C22]; Centro en Red de Medicina Regenerativa y Terapia Celular de Castilla y Leon; [0624_2IQBIONEURO_6_E]","(ANPCyT-FONCyT, Argentina)(ANPCyTFONCyT); (Spanish Government)(Spanish Government); (Interreg V Espan?a Portugal POCTEP); (Junta de Castilla y Leon)(Junta de Castilla y Leon); (Interreg V Espana Portugal POCTEP); Centro en Red de Medicina Regenerativa y Terapia Celular de Castilla y Leon;","We thank Dr. Mozzi for providing the Weisella strain and the following fundings: PICT 1705 (ANPCyT-FONCyT, Argentina) , PID2019-110709RB-100, RTI2018-096320-B-C22, RED2018-102417-T (Spanish Government) , VA317P18, Infrared2018-UVA06 (Junta de Castilla y Leon) , 0624_2IQBIONEURO_6_E (Interreg V Espana Portugal POCTEP) and Centro en Red de Medicina Regenerativa y Terapia Celular de Castilla y Leon.

In this context, renewable and biodegradable bioplastics possess great potential to replace petroleum-based plastics in mitigating these environmental issues. Fabrication of bioplastic films involves a delicate mixture of the film-forming agent, plasticizer and suitable solvent. The role of the plasticizer is to improve film flexibility, whereas the filler serves as a reinforcement medium. In recent years, much research attention has been shifted toward devising diverse methods for enhancing the performance of bioplastics, particularly in the utilization of environmentally benign nanoparticles to displace the conventional hazardous chemicals. Along this line, this paper presents the emergence of nanofillers and plasticizers utilized in bioplastic fabrication with a focus on starch-based bioplastics. This review paper not only highlights the influencing factors that affect the optical, mechanical and barrier properties of bioplastics, but also revolves around the proposed mechanism of starch-based bioplastic formation, which has rarely been reviewed in the current literature. To complete the review, prospects and challenges in bioplastic fabrication are also highlighted in order to align with the concept of the circular bioplastic economy and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","[Tan, Shiou Xuan; Andriyana, Andri] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Andriyana, Andri] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Ctr Adv Mat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Ong, Hwai Chyuan] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Future Technol Res Ctr, 123 Univ Rd,Sect 3, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Lim, Steven; Pang, Yean Ling] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Lim, Steven; Pang, Yean Ling] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ctr Photon & Adv Mat Res, Kajang 43000, Malaysia; [Ngoh, Gek Cheng] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; National Yunlin University Science & Technology; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Universiti Malaya,"Lim, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia.;Lim, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ctr Photon & Adv Mat Res, Kajang 43000, Malaysia.;Ngoh, GC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",kva190014@siswa.um.edu.my; andri.andriyana@um.edu.my; onghc@yuntech.edu.tw; stevenlim@utar.edu.my; pangyl@utar.edu.my; ngoh@um.edu.my,"Ong, Hwai Chyuan/A-9492-2013; ANDRIYANA, ANDRI/B-8226-2010; Ngoh, Gek Cheng/JAC-5317-2023; Pang, Yean Ling/S-6726-2019","Ngoh, Gek Cheng/0000-0003-2442-3297; Tan, Shiou Xuan/0000-0003-3299-4145; Pang, Yean Ling/0000-0003-0060-3402","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2018/TK10/UTAR/02/1]; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund [UTARRF/6200-W83]; Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, under the RU Grant [GPF059A-2020]","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education, Malaysia; Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund; Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, under the RU Grant","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2018/TK10/UTAR/02/1], Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman Research Fund (UTARRF/6200-W83), Malaysia and Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, under the RU Grant (GPF059A-2020).",,126,35,37,16,110,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,FEB,2022,14,4,,,,,,,664,10.3390/polym14040664,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym14040664,,,27,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,ZN6TW,35215577,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000765165100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Assessing the Role of Education for Sustainability,SOCIAL FORCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECOLOGICALLY UNEQUAL EXCHANGE; CARBON INTENSITY; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; MATERNAL MORTALITY; LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEALTH; FOOTPRINTS; WORLD; CONSUMPTION,"The United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development calls on nation states to invest in national development trajectories that promote both human and environmental well-being. Given the complexity of this plan, and the increasing severity of the climate crisis, understanding the relationship between nations' social and environmental outcomes is a critical task for social scientists. Raising national rates of educational attainment is a cornerstone national and international governance goal. This paper integrates Amartya Sen's conceptualization of education as the expansion of human capabilities, with the ecological modernization position that more educated societies may be less ecologically intensive, and tests the resultant hypothesis that gains in education may support global sustainability. Specifically, this study uses two-way fixed effects longitudinal modeling techniques to assess the relationship between national educational attainment and the carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) for 76 nations between 1960 and 2010. The CIWB ratio is a well-established metric for sustainability within sociology. The findings indicate that gains in educational attainment played an important historical role in reducing the carbon intensity with which nation states produce well-being for its citizens. Less encouraging, from a global sustainability perspective, is the uneven distribution of these desirable effects across regions, and the diminishment of the education effect over time in all regions outside of advanced economies.","[Kelly, Orla] Boston Coll, Environm Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Kelly, Orla] Harvard Univ, FXB Ctr Hlth & Human Rights, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston College; Harvard University,"Kelly, O (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Environm Sociol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.;Kelly, O (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, FXB Ctr Hlth & Human Rights, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kellyo@bc.edu,,"Kelly, Orla/0000-0002-5835-4624",,,,,99,18,22,3,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-7732,1534-7605,,SOC FORCES,Soc.

We argue that women join essential oil MLMs based on an iterative, three-pronged strategy that not only recruits women as oil distributors but also simultaneously indoctrinates them to pastel QAnon conspiracy spaces: digitally driven, feminized realms situated at the nexus of New Age spirituality, wellness, and far-right ideologies. MLM distributors first compel women to look toward essential oils as a viable medical intervention by leveraging potential recruits' distrust with medical establishments and hardship produced by intersecting structural inequalities (classism, racism, ableism, sexism). Women are then hooked in by promises of essential oils offering silver-bullet solutions to complex problems stemming from inequitable social systems. Finally, women get downlined into pastel QAnon disinformation flows through algorithmic production of confirmation bias. By coding qualitative data of MLM distributors and pastel QAnon influencers for digital content analysis, we identify socio-cultural and gendered trends of disinformation production at the intersections of wellness, pastel QAnon, and structural inequalities. These findings provide insights into the seductive appeal of disinformation beyond the textual content of the message and contribute to our understanding of the larger political economy of incentives and rewards that perpetuate disinformation-for-hire communities.","[Mastrangelo, Frankie; Longo, Gina Marie] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sociol Dept, Richmond, VA USA; [Mastrangelo, Frankie; Longo, Gina Marie] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sociol Dept, 827 W Franklin St,2nd Floor,Founders Hall, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Mastrangelo, F (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sociol Dept, 827 W Franklin St,2nd Floor,Founders Hall, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",mastrangelofa@vcu.edu,"Longo, Gina/AAY-2519-2021","Mastrangelo, Frankie/0009-0000-5675-7107",,,,,53,0,0,3,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Maharashtra is bestowed with a coastline of 720 km spread over 7 coastal districts, viz. Thane, Palghar, Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg along the Arabian sea with rich marine fishery resources. There are 25 fishing zones in the seven districts with 173 fish landing centres. The total marine fish production from the state during 2018-19 was 4.6 MT valued at T6298 crores (DOF, Government of Maharashtra). The state offers huge potential for the sustainable utilization of the marine bioresources for fisheries, mariculture, coastal aquaculture and post -harvest development and exports. Maharashtra falls under the NorthWest coast which contributes the highest (32.8%) in the total catch during 2019-20. The major share is contributed by pelagic resources (39%), followed by crustaceans (31%), demersal comprising 22% and molluscs (7%). The prominent species/groupwise landings include non-penaeid shrimp (21%), penaeid shrimp (9%).

This condition affects the quality of a patient's life and has a pronounced impact on both their physical and mental state. Treatment of these skin conditions with conventional approaches shows a lack of efficacy, long treatment duration, recurrence of conditions, systemic side effects, etc., due to improper drug delivery. However, these pitfalls can be overcome with the applications of nanomedicine-based approaches that provide efficient site-specific drug delivery at the target site. These nanomedicine-based strategies are evolved as potential treatment opportunities in the form of nanocarriers such as polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers, nanoemulsions along with emerging others viz. carbon nanotubes for dermatological treatment. The current review focuses on challenges faced by the existing conventional treatments along with the topical therapeutic perspective of nanocarriers in treating various skin diseases. A total of 213 articles have been reviewed and the application of different nanocarriers in treating various skin diseases has been explained in detail through case studies of previously published research works.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic discovered in China and rapidly spread across the globe, infecting millions, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, and severe downturns in the economies of countries worldwide. Biosurfactants can play a significant role in the prevention, control and treatment of diseases caused by these pathogenic agents through various therapeutic, pharmaceutical, environmental and hygiene approaches. Biosurfactants have the potential to inhibit microbial species with virulent intrinsic characteristics capable of developing diseases with high morbidity and mortality, as well as interrupting their spread through environmental and hygiene interventions. This is possible due to their antimicrobial activity, ability to interact with cells forming micelles and to interact with the immune system, and compatibility with relevant processes such as nanoparticle synthesis. They, therefore, can be applied in developing innovative and more effective pharmaceutical, therapeutics, sustainable and friendly environmental management approaches, less toxic formulations, and more efficient cleaning agents. These approaches can be easily integrated into relevant product development pipelines and implemented as measures for combating and managing pandemics.

As transistors reach their physical limits, the semiconductor industry is seeking the next alternative to sustain its economy and to unfold a new era of human civilization. In this context, a completely new information token, i.e., ions instead of electrons, is promising. The current trend in solid-state nanoionics for applications in energy storage, sensing, and brain-type information processing, requires the ability to control the properties of matter at the ultimate atomic scale. Here, a conceptually novel nanoarchitectonic strategy is proposed for controlling the number of dopant atoms in a solid electrolyte to obtain discrete electrical properties. Using alpha-Ag2+delta S nanodots with a finite number of nonstoichiometry excess dopants as a model system, a theory matched with experiments is presented that reveals the role of physical parameters, namely, the separation between electrochemical energy levels and the cohesive energy, underlying atomic-scale manipulation of dopants in nanodots. This strategy can be applied to different nanoscale materials as their properties strongly depend on the number of doping atoms/ions, and has the potential to create a new paradigm based on controlled single atom/ion transfer.","[Nayak, Alpana; Unayama, Satomi; Tsuruoka, Tohru; Aono, Masakazu] Natl Inst Mat Sci, WPI Ctr Mat Nanoarchitecton, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Tai, Seishiro; Hasegawa, Tsuyoshi] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Waser, Rainer; Valov, Ilia] Res Ctr Juelich, Peter Gruenberg Inst, Elect Mat, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Waser, Rainer; Valov, Ilia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, IWE2, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Waser, Rainer; Valov, Ilia] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, JARA FIT, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Nayak, Alpana] Indian Inst Technol Patna, Dept Phys, Patna 801106, Bihar, India",National Institute for Materials Science; Waseda University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Patna,"Hasegawa, T (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",thasega@waseda.jp,"TSURUOKA, Tohru/H-2519-2011; Valov, Ilia/J-7021-2013; Waser, Rainer/J-6103-2013","Valov, Ilia/0000-0002-0728-7214; Waser, Rainer/0000-0002-9080-8980","JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H00972, JP16K13689]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H00972, 16K13689] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Part of this study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16H00972 and JP16K13689.

In addition to economic growth, environmental pollution is a product of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as well. However, whether and how ICTs may affect these systems is unclear. Based on a more comprehensive measurement of ICTs, the current study has investigated the impact of ICTs, education, and economic performance on environmental sustainability from 2000 to 2019 across 93 countries categorized as low-income, middle-income, and high-income. Contrary to preceding studies, this research has used advanced econometric techniques to counter heterogeneities and dependencies in the data and, thus, has produced more trustworthy and efficient results. The finding obtained from the Bias-corrected method of the moment's estimator and Driscoll and Kraal's standard error techniques are consistent. According to the results, ICTs have a heterogenous effect on environmental sustainability across low-, middle- and high-income countries. Further results have revealed that education plays a significant role in maintaining environmental sustainability across middle-and high-income groups but does not seem to do so for lower-income groups. Environmental education for all should be part of the policy measures to tackle climate change across all income groups.","[Iqbal, Kashif; Shuo, Wang] Shanghai Dianji Univ, Sch Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yichu] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies SOAS, London, England; [Danish; Li, Nan] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Trade & Econ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Khan, Salahuddin] King Saud Univ, Coll Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Mahmood, Nasir] Wuhan Business Sch, Wuhan, Hebei, Peoples R China",Shanghai Dianji University; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Guangdong University of Foreign Studies; King Saud University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies SOAS, London, England.;Li, N (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Trade & Econ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",wangyichu1993@163.com; linan010@126.com,"Iqbal, Kashif/C-9582-2018; Wang, Shuo/U-2916-2019; -, Danish/AEV-8555-2022; Khan, Salah Uddin/ABC-5995-2020",", Danish/0000-0003-1046-1655","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP2023R58]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","The authors sincerely appreciate funding from Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP2023R58), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,60,3,3,4,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

Hydrogels are a type of material that have been extensively investigated in recent decades. Their physical and chemical properties, such as hydrophilicity, resemblance to living systems, swelling ability and modifiability, make them suitable to be exploited for many pharmaceutical and bioengineering applications. This review deals with a brief account of green-manufactured hydrogels, their characteristics, preparations, importance in the field of green biomedical technology and their future perspectives. Only hydrogels based on biopolymers, and primarily on polysaccharides, are considered. Particular attention is given to the processes of extracting such biopolymers from natural sources and the various emerging problems for their processing, such as solubility. Hydrogels are catalogued according to the main biopolymer on which they are based and, for each type, the chemical reactions and the processes that enable their assembly are identified. The economic and environmental sustainability of these processes are commented on. The possibility of large-scale processing in the production of the investigated hydrogels are framed in the context of an economy aimed at waste reduction and resource recycling.","[Trombino, Sonia; Sole, Roberta; Di Gioia, Maria Luisa; Procopio, Debora; Curcio, Federica; Cassano, Roberta] Univ Calabria, Dept Pharm Hlth & Nutr Sci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Curcio, F; Cassano, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Pharm Hlth & Nutr Sci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",federica.curcio@unical.it; roberta.cassano@unical.it,"Cannataro, Roberto/ABH-6608-2020; Di Gioia, Maria/I-5830-2019","Trombino, Sonia/0000-0001-9939-4457; Procopio, Debora/0000-0001-8071-0288",,,,,247,19,19,3,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,MAR,2023,28,5,,,,,,,2107,10.3390/molecules28052107,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052107,,,32,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,9U0VV,36903352,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000947440800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a pertinent use and control of its processing route and parameters need to be looked into for effective sustainability of the industries and resources involved. The application of Mechanical activation (MA) in the extractive metallurgical process (hydrometallurgy) has vehemently improved the conversion of waste to wealth compared to other pretreatment methods. Some industrial wastes are hazardous and they are heap-dumped, negatively influencing the environment they occupied. This present work reviewed the hazardous industrial solid wastes ( HISWs) from which economically valuable metals (EVMs) were recovered and the economic and environmental benefits of recovering via the Mechanical Activation Hydrometallurgical process. The influence of both MA and leaching parameters on the recovery efficiency was shown. The detailed analysis of the optimum conditions of these MA-leaching processes was also reported on the ground of critical evaluation of the scientific literature scrutiny.

This dataset has been updated with the material composition range of several alloys included in the European standard EN 1753:2019. The balanced, maximum, and minimum environmental impact values were obtained. In general, the overall impact of the studied magnesium alloys varied from 3.046 Pt/kg to 4.853 Pt/kg and from 43.439 kg CO2 eq./kg to 55.427 kg CO2 eq./kg, depending on the composition. In the analysis of maximum and minimum environmental impacts, the alloy that had the highest uncertainty was 3.5251, with a range of +/- 7.20%. The element that contributed the most to increase its impact was silver. The AZ91 alloy, provided by the EcoInvent dataset, had a lower environmental impact than all the magnesium alloys studied in this work.

At the same time, copper nanoclusters have attracted people's attention because of their non-toxicity, large Stokes shift and economy. In this paper, we fabricated 1-dodecanethiol (DT)-capped self-assembled copper nanoclusters in colloidal solution with yellow light emission and characterized the prepared self-assembled copper nanoclusters by UV-visible spectra, TEM and PL characterization methods. Self-assembled copper nanoclusters were used as color conversion layers for the manufacture of white light-emitting diodes. The prepared white LED has good color properties, the color rendering index was 79.3, the CIE color coordinates located at (0.3213,0.3255) and the color temperature was 6067K.

Micrometer thin, massively parallel silicon sheets, very tall Si microneedles, zigzag bent Si nanowires, and tunnel drilling into Si substrates have all been demonstrated. The technique, utilizing narrow array of Au/Fe/Au trilayer etch lines, is particularly effective in producing only micrometer-thick Si sheets by rapid and inexpensive means with only 5 mu m level slicing loss of Si material, thus practically eliminating the waste (and also the use) of Si material compared to the similar to 200 mu m kerf loss per slicing and similar to 200 mu m thick wafer in the typical saw-cut Si solar cell preparation.

Because of this problem, particular emphasis will be placed on wastewater recycling.Conventional wastewater treatment methods may be limited due to high investment costs or, in some cases, poor treatment efficiency. To address these issues in, it is necessary to continuously evaluate novel technologies that complement and improve these traditional wastewater treatment processes. In this regard, technologies based on nanomaterials are also being studied. These technologies improve wastewater management and constitute one of the main focuses of nanotechnology.The following review describes wastewater's primary biological, organic, and inorganic contaminants. Subsequently, it focuses on the potential of different nanomaterials (metal oxides, carbon-based nanomaterials, cellulose-based nanomaterials), membrane, and nanobioremediation processes for wastewater treatment. The above is evident from the review of various publications. However, nanomaterials' cost, toxicity, and biodegradability need to be addressed before their commercial distribution and scale-up. The development of nanomaterials and nanoproducts must be sustainable and safe throughout the nanoproduct life cycle to meet the requirements of the circular economy.","[Perez, Heilyn; Quintero Garcia, Omar Jasiel; Rodriguez Vazquez, Refugio] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Nacl Estudios Avanzados, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 2508, Mexico City 07360, DF, Mexico; [Amezcua Allieri, Myriam Adela] Inst Mexicano Petr, Gerencia Transformac Biomasa, Eje Cent Lazaro Cardenas Norte 152, Mexico City 07730, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo,"Pérez, H (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Nacl Estudios Avanzados, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 2508, Mexico City 07360, DF, Mexico.",heilyn9102@gmail.com,"Amezcua Allieri, Myriam/F-6748-2018","Amezcua Allieri, Myriam/0000-0003-1101-6334; Perez, Heilyn/0000-0003-2127-8311",,,,,239,14,14,6,36,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",0273-1223,1996-9732,,WATER SCI TECHNOL,Water Sci.

By broadening the understanding of post-retirement employment behaviour from a consumer welfare perspective, this study expands the literature on retirement consumption and provides theoretical explanations, empirical insights and policy recommendations. The findings reveal that post-retirement employment behaviour reduces urban retirees' household expenditure and has a more significant effect on men than on women, but this effect diminishes as consumption levels rise. Increasing income, promoting social participation and improving subjective health outcomes are all potential channels through which post-retirement employment can affect consumption. Further analysis shows two main reasons why post-retirement employment reduces older people's expenditure: first, the increase in subjective health levels resulting from post-retirement employment reduces healthcare expenditure; second, post-retirement employment does not promote social participation and self-rated health for all consumption levels and all genders of retirees - it also decreases expenditure. Preliminary evidence suggests that internet use positively moderates the negative impact of post-retirement employment on older people's expenditure. These findings provide policy implications for retirement policies and the promotion of the silver economy.","[Lu, Di] Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Res Ctr, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Lu, Di] Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Collage, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xing] Liaoning Univ, Fac Econ, Sch Econ, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Ji, Shujing] Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Changchun, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University; Liaoning University; Jilin University of Finance & Economics,"Lu, D (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Res Ctr, Changchun, Peoples R China.;Lu, D (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Collage, Changchun, Peoples R China.",ludi@jlu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [21CTJ021],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (No.21CTJ021).,,75,0,0,27,29,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0144-686X,1469-1779,,AGEING SOC,Ageing Soc.,2024 OCT 7,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1017/S0144686X24000461,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X24000461,,OCT 2024,35,Gerontology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,I0R4O,,Bronze,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001327414800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the kinetic behavior of precious metals Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd between copper matte and iron-silicate slag was investigated at a typical flash smelting temperature of 1300 degrees C in both air and argon atmospheres. SEM-EDS, EPMA, and LA-ICP-MS-advanced analysis methods were used for sample characterization. The results indicate that precious metals favor the matte phase over slag, and the deportment to matte occurred swiftly within a short time after the system had reached the experimental temperature. With increasing contact times, the precious metals were distributed increasingly into the sulfide matte. The distribution coefficients, based on experimentally measured element concentrations, followed the order of palladium>platinum>gold>silver in both air and argon, and the matte acted as an efficient collector of these precious metals. The obtained results can be applied to industrial copper matte smelting processes, and they also help in upgrading CFD models to simulate the flash smelting process more precisely.","[Wan, Xingbang; Kleemola, Lotta; Klemettinen, Lassi; Taskinen, Pekka; Jokilaakso, Ari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16100, Aalto 00076, Finland; [O'Brien, Hugh] Geol Survey Finland, Vuorimiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University; Geological Survey of Finland (GTK),"Jokilaakso, A (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16100, Aalto 00076, Finland.",xingbang.wan@aalto.fi; lotta.kleemola@aalto.fi; lassi.klemettinen@aalto.fi; hugh.obrien@gtk.fi; pekka.taskinen@aalto.fi; ari.jokilaakso@aalto.fi,"Klemettinen, Lassi/AAA-4936-2020; Jokilaakso, Ari/AAP-6978-2020; Taskinen, Pekka/K-4292-2015","Jokilaakso, Ari/0000-0003-0582-7181; Klemettinen, Lassi/0000-0001-9633-7131; Taskinen, Pekka/0000-0002-4054-952X; Kleemola, Lotta/0000-0002-6098-2443; Wan, xingbang/0000-0001-8378-7600",Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering; Business Finland [3891/31/2018]; China Scholarship Council [201706370096],Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering; Business Finland; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was financially supported by the Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering and the Business Finland financed SYMMET project [Grant number 3891/31/2018].

Although many bacteria synthesize BC, the most efficient BC producers are certain species of the genera Komagataeibacter and Novacetimonas. These are also food-grade bacteria, simplifying their utilization at industrial facilities. The basic principles of BC synthesis are known from studies of Komagataeibacter xylinus, which became a model species for studying BC at genetic and molecular levels. Cellulose can also be of plant origin, but BC surpasses its purity. Moreover, the laboratory production of BC enables in situ modification into functionalized material with incorporated molecules during its synthesis. The possibility of growing Komagataeibacter and Novacetimonas species on various organic substrates and agricultural and food waste compounds also follows the green and sustainable economy principles. Further intervention into BC synthesis was enabled by genetic engineering tools, subsequently directing it into the field of synthetic biology. This review paper presents the development of the fascinating field of BC synthesis at the molecular level, seeking sustainable ways for its production and its applications towards genetic modifications of bacterial strains for producing novel types of living biomaterials using the flexible metabolic machinery of bacteria.","[Potocnik, Vid; Trcek, Janja] Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Gorgieva, Selestina] Univ Maribor, Inst Engn Mat & Design, Fac Mech Engn, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Trcek, Janja] Univ Maribor, Fac Chem & Chem Engn, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Trcek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.;Trcek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Chem & Chem Engn, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.",vid.potocnik.2@gmail.com; selestina.gorgieva@um.si; janja.trcek@um.si,"Gorgieva, Selestina/HHM-6236-2022","Gorgieva, Selestina/0000-0002-2180-1603; Trcek, Janja/0000-0002-5605-2972","Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency [P2-0006, P2-0118, J2-2487]",Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency,"This research was funded by the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency through research programs P2-0006, P2-0118 and research project J2-2487.",,144,27,27,13,68,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,AUG,2023,15,16,,,,,,,3466,10.3390/polym15163466,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym15163466,,,25,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,Q2HO9,37631523,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001055781300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present work reviews the available literature about using mining and electronic waste (e-waste) for recycling-extracting metallic products and their transformation into nanomaterials (NMs). The applications and challenges of these NMs were also analyzed and discussed. Acid and alkaline treatments were the main recovery methods, while the synthesis by chemical reduction was the most used for the fabrication of NPs. Nano-alloy, Cu, Fe, and Au NPs were the main products obtained from PCBs and tailing waste. In addition, catalysis, sensors, and antimicrobial activity were the primary applications described. Due to the reutilization of metallic raw, direct transformation, low-cost, and eco-friendly synthesis processes could be an attractive alternative to the production of NPs on large scales.

REEs are essential raw materials for emerging and high technologies. China currently dominates global REE production with a proportion of 97%. To increase the independence of REE supply and eliminate the environmental impacts related to REE mining, methods for an efficient REE recovery from secondary sources like EW are needed. In this work, we examine improvements in pre-treatment and acidic leaching processes to recover REEs and other valuable metals. EW was crushed and ground prior to the sieving. The materials obtained were then subjected to acid leaching. The parameters used to optimize the conditions for leaching were as follows: acid type (HCl, HNO3, and aqua regia), particle size, and waste-to-acid ratio. The maximum leaching efficiency was obtained from the ground, sieved, and undersized part of e-waste by using HCl with a W:A of 12.5 mg/mL. The total REE concentration was 435 mg/kg. Several treatment scenarios are identified with promise for improving REE recovery at full scale in EW recovery plants and thereby advancing goals for a sustainable, circular economy.","[Yuksekdag, Ayse; Kose-Mutlu, Borte; Zeytuncu-Gokoglu, Bihter; Koyuncu, Ismail] Istanbul Tech Univ, Natl Res Ctr Membrane Technol, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yuksekdag, Ayse; Koyuncu, Ismail] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Environm Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kose-Mutlu, Borte] Istanbul Tech Univ, Mol Biol & Genet Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Zeytuncu-Gokoglu, Bihter] Istanbul Tech Univ, Met & Mat Engn Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kumral, Mustafa] Istanbul Tech Univ, Geol Engn Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey; [Wiesner, Mark R.] Duke Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University; Istanbul Technical University; Duke University,"Kose-Mutlu, B; Koyuncu, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Natl Res Ctr Membrane Technol, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.;Koyuncu, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Environm Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.;Kose-Mutlu, B (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Mol Biol & Genet Dept, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkey.",kosebo@itu.edu.tr; koyuncu@itu.edu.tr,"Mutlu, Börte/AAA-5815-2022; Kose Mutlu, Borte/C-1255-2018; Yuksekdag, Ayse/ABB-1133-2020; KUMRAL, Mustafa/ABF-7616-2020","Kose Mutlu, Borte/0000-0001-9747-5499; Yuksekdag, Ayse/0000-0002-7751-7556; KUMRAL, Mustafa/0000-0001-7827-8721",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [117Y357]; Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Scientific Research Project [41893],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Scientific Research Project(Istanbul Technical University),This study was financially supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under Project No. 117Y357 and Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Scientific Research Project (Project ID: 41893).,,35,18,18,6,58,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This renovation will require huge amounts of raw materials, some of them with high supply risks. To assess such risks a new methodology is proposed, identifying possible bottlenecks of future demand versus geological availability. This has been applied to the world development of wind power, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power and passenger electric vehicles for the 2016-2050 time period under a business as usual scenario considering the impact on 31 different raw materials. As a result, 13 elements were identified to have very high or high risk, meaning that these could generate bottlenecks in the future: cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gallium, indium, lithium, manganese, nickel, silver, tellurium, tin and zinc. Tellurium, which is mostly demanded to manufacture solar photovoltaic cells, presents the highest risk. To overcome these constraints, measures consisting on improving recycling rates from 0.1% to 4.6% per year could avoid material shortages or restrictions in green technologies. For instance, lithium recycling rate should increase from 1% to 4.8% in 2050. This study aims to serve as a guideline for developing eco-design and recycling strategies.","[Valero, Alicia; Ortego, Abel] CIRCE Ctr Res Energy Resources & Consumpt, Zaragoza, Spain; [Valero, Antonio; Calvo, Guiomar] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Valero, A (通讯作者)，CIRCE Ctr Res Energy Resources & Consumpt, Zaragoza, Spain.",aliciavd@unizar.es,"Delgado, Alicia/Z-6141-2019; Calvo Sevillano, Guiomar/L-2006-2015; /L-9280-2014","Calvo Sevillano, Guiomar/0000-0001-9263-7321; Valero Delgado, Alicia/0000-0003-3330-1793; /0000-0003-0702-733X; Ortego, Abel/0000-0002-6148-1253","European Commission [691287]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [ENE2017-85224-R]","European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","This paper has been carried out under the framework of MEDEAS project (Guiding European Policy toward a low-carbon economy: Modelling Energy system Development under Environmental and Socioeconomic constraints), Grant agreement no. 691287, financed by the European Commission within the context of the H2020 programme, and under the ENE2017-85224-R project, financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness.",,118,236,248,20,220,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Facing the continuously mutating virus, this crisis has heightened concerns among consumers and businesses regarding viral transmission through seafood, particularly in the face of emerging, unknown viruses, underscoring our preparedness gaps. This review provides a succinct overview of the survival mechanisms of prevalent viruses in seafood, examines potential transmission pathways to humans during seafood processing, and discusses strategies for mitigating their spread throughout the seafood supply chain. Furthermore, the discussion highlights emerging trends in innovative antiviral technologies aimed at enhancing food safety. Person-to-person transmission remains the most likely source of infection within the supply chain. Therefore, it is still imperative to adhere to the implementation of standard processes, namely good manufacturing practices (GMP) and good hygiene practices (GHP), in the seafood business. In light of the significant losses caused by this crisis and the persistent presence of various viruses within the seafood supply chain, efforts are needed to implement predictive and preventive measures against potential emerging viruses. Future research should focus on monitoring and limiting viral transmission by integrating Industry 4.0 applications, smart technologies, and antiviral packaging, maximizing the potential of these emerging solutions.","[Lin, Dingsong; Chen, Wendi; Lin, Zejia; Liu, Lingdai; Zhang, Molan; Liu, Zifei] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Sci, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Yang, Hongshun] Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Coll Light Ind & Food Sci, Guangzhou 510225, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lin] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Chem Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Singapore 637459, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Zhongkai University of Agriculture & Engineering; Nanyang Technological University,"Liu, ZF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Sci, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Singapore 117543, Singapore.;Chen, L (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Chem Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Singapore 637459, Singapore.",e0506474@u.nus.edu; chen.lin@ntu.edu.sg,,"CHEN, WENDI/0009-0009-2782-1443",,,,,171,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2304-8158,,FOODS,Foods,MAR 20,2025,14,6,,,,,,,1071,10.3390/foods14061071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods14061071,,,30,Food Science & Technology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology,0OQ7W,40232102,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001452355300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recycling precious metals from waste is a promising strategy, here we tactfully utilize light irradiation as an environmental-friendly and energy-saving adjunctive strategy to promote the reduction of precious metal ions, thereby improving the adsorption capacity and kinetics. A newly light-sensitive covalent organic framework (PP-COF) was synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this light auxiliary strategy. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of PP-COF with light irradiation towards gold, platinum, and silver ions are 4729, 573, and 519mgg(-1), which are 3.3, 1.9, and 1.2times the adsorption capacities under dark condition. Significantly, a filtration column with PP-COF can recover more than 99.8% of the gold ions in the simulated e-waste leachates with light irradiation, and 1gram of PP-COF can recover gold from up to 0.15tonne of e-waste leachates. Interestingly, the captured precious metals by PP-COF with light irradiation mainly exist in the micron-sized particles, which can be easily separated by extraction. We believe this work can contribute to precious metal recovery and circular economy for recycling resources.","[Cheng, Yuan-Zhe; He, Yujian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yuan-Zhe; Jiang, Di; Ji, Wenyan; Yang, Dong-Hui; Ding, Xuesong; Han, Bao-Hang] Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Nanosyst & Hierarch Fabricat, CAS Ctr Excellence Nanosci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Bao, Xiaotian; Liu, Xinfeng] Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol Beijing, CAS Key Lab Standardizat & Measurement Nanotechno, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yuan-Zhe; Jiang, Di; He, Yujian; Han, Bao-Hang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center for Nanoscience & Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center for Nanoscience & Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","He, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Chem Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Yang, DH; Ding, XS; Han, BH (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol, CAS Key Lab Nanosyst & Hierarch Fabricat, CAS Ctr Excellence Nanosci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Liu, XF (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol Beijing, CAS Key Lab Standardizat & Measurement Nanotechno, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;He, YJ; Han, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",yangdh@nanoctr.cn; dingxs@nanoctr.cn; liuxf@nanoctr.cn; heyujian@ucas.ac.cn; hanbh@nanoctr.cn,"Cheng, Yuan-Zhe/LSL-0008-2024; Sun, Licheng/P-2657-2019; yang, donghui/J-7974-2018; Ding, Xuesong/F-7545-2015; HAN, Bao-Hang/B-7069-2009",,"National Key R&D Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2022YFE0101800]; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [121D11KYSB20210018]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51972302, 22161132010, 22075060, 22171057]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB36000000]",National Key R&D Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of China; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"The financial support of the National Key R&D Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant 2022YFE0101800), the International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant 121D11KYSB20210018), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 51972302, 22161132010, 22075060, and 22171057), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant XDB36000000) is acknowledged.",,55,4,4,65,78,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",,1521-3773,,ANGEW CHEM INT EDIT,Angew.

Therefore, this study aimed to recover the acid pickling residue from the Cu0.69Zn0.26Ni0.05 alloy. By using an economically viable and surfactant-free onepot coprecipitation hydrothermal process, a ZnO-rich microcomposite material was obtained, which had a high recovery yield of 20 g/L by reusing residual water in a cyclic process. The material's composition was confirmed through electronic and crystalline characterizations determined by UV-Vis, Photoluminescence, FTIR, XRD, and XPS. Moreover, the morphological characterization showed that the wurtzite ZnO grows on the CuO surface, forming rod-like structures with high surface areas, as observed through SEM and TEM analysis. The microstructure exhibits favorable properties that enable the degradation of a pollutant model in an aqueous solution, as well as the inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Unlike other works in the literature, the creation of a valuable product from a harmful residue did not require complex metal separation steps. These promising results bode well for the development of functional materials based on green economy principles, thereby facilitating large-scale treatment of industrial metallurgy residues.","[Kassab, Lais M.; Martini, William S.; Pellosi, Diogo S.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Chem, Lab Hybrid Mat, Diadema, Brazil; [Santos, Vinicius T.; Lobo, Flavia G.; Silva, Marcio R.] Termomecan Sao Paulo SA, Dept Res & Dev, BR-09612000 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil; [Vital, Vitor G.; Lima, Lucas F.; de Vasconcellos, Suzan P.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Multidisciplinary Lab Hlth & Environm, Diadema, Brazil; [da Silva, Ricardo A.

Towards the sustainable manufacturing of smart textiles, biodegradable, recycled, and bio-based plastics are used as alternative raw materials for fabric and yarn production using a wide variety of techniques. While conventional techniques present several drawbacks, nanofibers produced through electrospinning have superior structural properties. Electrospinning is an innovative method for fiber production based on the use of electrostatic force to create charged threads of polymer solutions. Electrospinning shows great potential since it provides control of the size, porosity, and mechanical resistance of the fibers.

The study area is situated in the upper Durance valley, a major mining region from the 11th to the end of the 13th century. Man sought and extracted silver-bearing ore from the valley bottoms to the summit of the mountains. He employed firesetting to attack the hard gneiss bedrock. The study of residual charcoal has been used to measure the impact of the mining economy on the development of mountain forests. The example of the small district of Faravel situated in an upper mountainous region (1900-2150 m altitude), illustrates a supply anchored at subalpine level with a gradual extension of the source area towards the timberline. The anthracological spectra document extinction of Pinus cembra L at subalpine level and the lowering of the upper limit of the dense forest dominated by Larix decidua Mill. These changes are the result of agropastoral and mining pressure, as testified by both surviving manuscripts and archaeology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Its essential oils have been used in different industries, because of its biological properties. Objective: Identify the perspectives of the biotechnological applications of Lippia alba essential oils. Methodology: A scoping review was conducted on the biological activity of Lippia alba essential oils registered until October, 2018 in EBSCO, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, SciELO, and Lilacs databases. Results: Chemotypes I and III have been reported for different biological activities from the evaluations performed on microorganisms, fish, arthropods, small mammals, and cell lines; fundamentally associated with antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antioxidant, and sedative effects, among others. Records focused mainly on the health, fishing industry, and agrifood sectors. Conclusion: Studies on the effect of essential oil are promising, but do not reflect a continuity of the research toward prototypes or finished commercial products. Research groups must unify evaluation methodologies and include in all studies the relationship between phytochemical and biological activity for the meta-analyses to be possible. Likewise, they must join efforts through the National System for Agricultural Innovation (SNIA, for the term in Spanish) to generate finished products that impact upon society and facilitate progress in the country's bio-economy.","[Ortega-Cuadros, Mailen] Univ Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; [Acosta de Guevara, Ema E.; Molina Castillo, Aden D.; Gutierrez Castaneda, Clara] Univ Libre Secc Barranquilla, Grp Invest Gest Ecol & Agroind, Proyecto Aplicabilidad Biotecnol Aceite Esencial, Km 7 Antigua Via Puerto Colombia, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Castro Amaris, Glorismar] Univ Popular Cesar, Grp Invest Parasitol Agroecol Milenio, Valledupar, Colombia; [Tofino-Rivera, Adrian P.] Corp Colombiana Invest Agr, AGROSAVIA, Ctr Invest Motilonia, Km 5 Via Becerril, Agustin Codazzi, Colombia","Universidad de Antioquia; Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA","Ortega-Cuadros, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia.",mailen.ortega@udea.edu.co; ema.acosta@unilibre.edu.co; ailend.molinac@unilibre.edu.co; clarag.gutierrezc@unilibre.edu.co; gcastroa@unicesar.edu.co; atofino@agrosavia.co,"Ortega Cuadros, Mailen/AFP-0152-2022","Ortega Cuadros, Mailen/0000-0002-4977-1709",Library at Universidad de Antioquia; Biblioteca Agropecuaria (BAC); AGROSAVIA,Library at Universidad de Antioquia; Biblioteca Agropecuaria (BAC); AGROSAVIA,"The authors thank the Library at Universidad de Antioquia, the Biblioteca Agropecuaria (BAC) and AGROSAVIA for funding the research Development of production systems based on aromatic and medicinal species in agro-ecological associations with improved vegetable varieties (hot pepper, bean, and eggplant) for degraded soils of the Caribbean, Development and validation of sustainable control strategies for parasitic diseases with the greatest productive impact on livestock systems in Colombia.

However, pests like the tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta) significantly reduce their yield potential. Nanoparticles come as a solution to this context, promising innovative strategies for the protection of plants from pest infestation and management. Nanoparticles have shown great potential to improve tomato plant resistance against pests and diseases because of their unique properties. They enhance plant physiological processes like photosynthesis and nutrient uptake while activating defense-related molecular pathways. Nanoparticles also directly impact the life cycle and behavioral patterns of pests such as the tomato leafminer, reducing their destructive nature. The dual benefits of nanoparticles for enhancing plants' health and managing pests effectively provide a two-way innovative approach in agriculture. Gains made with such technology not only include increasing crop productivity and reducing crop losses but also reducing the heavy dependence on chemical pesticides, many of which have been attributed to environmental hazards. The current study illustrates the broader implications of nanoparticle use in agriculture, which is a sustainable pathway to increase crop resilience and productivity while reducing the impact of pests. Such novel approaches underline the need for continued interdisciplinary research to exploit the potential of nanotechnology in sustainable agricultural practices fully.","[Haq, Inzamam Ul; Cai, Xiangyun; Akhtar, Muhammad Rehan; Ghafar, Muhammad Adeel; Hyder, Moazam; Hou, Youming] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Ecol Pest Control Fujian & Taiwan Cr, Key Lab Biopesticides & Chem Biol,MOE, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China; [Ali, Habib] Khwaja Fareed Univ Engn & Informat Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Rahim Yar Khan 64200, Punjab, Pakistan","Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering & Information Technology, Pakistan","Hou, YM (通讯作者)，Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Plant Protect, State Key Lab Ecol Pest Control Fujian & Taiwan Cr, Key Lab Biopesticides & Chem Biol,MOE, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China.",000b370305@fafu.edu.cn; 2220203003@fafu.edu.cn; habib.ali@kfueit.edu.pk; m.rehan@fafu.edu.cn; ymhou@fafu.edu.cn,"Ghafar, Muhammad/MCJ-9130-2025; cai, xiangyun/IXW-8395-2023; UlHaq, Inzamam/LWK-2253-2024; Ali, Dr. Habib/J-7526-2019","Hou, Youming/0000-0001-7984-9688; Cai, Xiang yun/0009-0006-9598-0698; Ghafar, Muhammad Adeel/0009-0009-8117-921X; Ali, Dr. Habib/0000-0003-4650-0345; Ul Haq, Inzamam/0000-0001-5707-3612",National Natural Science Foundation of China; [U22A20489]; [32361143791],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ;,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U22A20489; 32361143791).,,95,1,1,17,17,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,NOV,2024,14,22,,,,,,,1788,10.3390/nano14221788,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano14221788,,,19,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,N7E9Z,39591030,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001365937900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Developing powerful sensing tools for efficient and accurate screening of food hazards is urgently needed to strengthen the public faith in food safety.Scope and approach: Noble metal nanoparticles with extraordinary optical properties, particularly localized surface plasmon resonance, have been widely used to build sensors for food safety monitoring. The aggregation of noble metal nanoparticles can significantly promote the optical properties, enhance the electromagnetic field, and increase its hydrodynamic diameter. Thus, sensors based on aggregation of noble metal nanoparticles show excellent performance in screening hazardous substances in foods and promoting food safety.Key findings and conclusions: In this regard, the state-of-the-art sensors based on aggregation of noble metal nanoparticles for food safety monitoring were reviewed, with a focus on the sensing principles and analytical performance of selected representative food hazardous substances. Several examples of sensors based on aggregation of noble metal nanoparticles were highlighted, and the challenges and future perspective were elaborated.

Molecular-level understanding of the CO2RR process is instrumental for the better design of electrodes operable at low overpotentials with high current density. The catalytic mechanism underlying the turnover and selectivity of the CO2RR is modulated by the nature of the electrocatalyst, as well as the electrolyte liquid, and its ionic components that form the electrical double layer (EDL). Herein we demonstrate the critical non-innocent role of the EDL for the activation and conversion of CO2 at a high cathodic bias for electrocatalytic conversion over a silver surface as a representative low-cost model cathode. By using a multiscale modeling approach we demonstrate that under such conditions a dense EDL is formed, which hinders the diffusion of CO2 towards the Ag111 electrocatalyst surface. By combining DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we identify favorable pathways for CO2 reduction directly over the EDL without the need for adsorption to the catalyst surface. The dense EDL promotes homogeneous phase reduction of CO(2)via electron transfer from the surface to the electrolyte. Such an outer-sphere mechanism favors the formation of formate as the CO2RR product. The formate can undergo dehydration to CO via a transition state stabilized by solvated alkali cations in the EDL.","[Sinha, Vivek; Khramenkova, Elena; Pidko, Evgeny A.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Inorgan Syst Engn, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Sinha, V; Pidko, EA (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Inorgan Syst Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",v.sinha@tudelft.nl; e.a.pidko@tudelft.nl,"sinha, vivek/ABH-1216-2020; Pidko, Evgeny/A-7811-2008","Pidko, Evgeny/0000-0001-9242-9901; sinha, vivek/0000-0002-6856-9469",ARC-CBBC project [2016.008]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [725686]; NWO Domain Science; PRACE under the DECI; European Research Council (ERC) [725686] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ARC-CBBC project; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); NWO Domain Science; PRACE under the DECI; European Research Council (ERC),"V.

The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore whether the Romanian stock market is impacted by the crisis generated by novel coronavirus. Granger causality was employed to investigate the causalities among COVID-19 and stock market returns, as well as between pandemic measures and several commodities. The outcomes of the ARDL approach failed to find evidence towards the impact of Chinese COVID-19 records on the Romanian financial market, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term. On the other hand, our quantitative approach reveals a negative effect of the new deaths' cases from Italy on the 10-year Romanian bond yield both in the short-run and long-run. The econometric research provide evidence that Romanian 10-year government bond is more sensitive to the news related to COVID-19 than the index of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.

Although metal commodities are indispensable to industry and the economy, the influence of financialization on metal spot prices and in particular on respective volatility has been insufficiently studied. Therefore, we attempt to contribute to existing literature by examining potential effects of the lead-lag relationship on futures trading activity of commercial and non-commercial market participants and cash prices and volatility for the major metal commodities: copper, gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. After analyzing Commitment of Traders (COT) reports from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over a timeframe from January 1993 to December 2013, bi-directional Granger-causality tests and an EGARCH volatility analysis show that there is hardly any influence of trading activity driving metal spot prices in the long-term, but rather driving volatility to some extent. We find indications of price and volatility influencing effects of trading activity within sub-samples, such as phases of booms and crises. Contrary to public perception, commercial and long positions affect price levels and volatility far more than activities of non-commercial traders. However, for the reverse direction there is strong evidence that commodity prices and volatility drive trading positions.","[Mayer, Herbert; Rathgeber, Andreas; Wanner, Markus] Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Finance Informat & Resource Management, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",University of Augsburg,"Rathgeber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Inst Mat Resource Management, Finance Informat & Resource Management, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",herbert.mayer@mrm.uni-augsburg.de; andreas.rathgeber@mrm.uni-augsburg.de,,,"Bavarian Research Alliance (BayFOR) through the program ForChange; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts","Bavarian Research Alliance (BayFOR) through the program ForChange; Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts","This paper has already been presented among others at the following conferences: The 31th Spring International Conference of the French Finance Association (AFFI) 2014, the 21st Annual Conference of the Multinational Finance Society (MFS) 2014, the World Finance Conference 2015 and the thematic Semester on Commodity Derivatives Markets at the University Paris Dauphine in 2015.

The PCB end of life management starts with the component removal, then the PCBs are shredded into small particles. Eventually, different separation methods are applied to the pulverized material to separate metals and non-metals. The corona electrostatic separation is one of the methods that can be used for this purpose since it is able to separate the conductive and non-conductive materials. However, the lack of knowledge to set the process parameters may affect the efficiency of the corona electrostatic separation process, ultimately resulting in the loss of valuable materials. The simulation of particle trajectory can be very helpful to identify the effective process parameters of the separation process. Thus, in this study, a simulation model to predict the particles trajectories in a belt type corona electrostatic separator is developed with the help of COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB software. The model simulates the particle behavior taking into account the electrostatic, gravitational, centrifugal, electric image, and air drag forces. Moreover, the predicted particles trajectories are used to analyze the effects of the roll electrode voltage, angular velocity of roll electrode, and size of the particles on the separation process.","[Patil, Trunal; Rebaioli, Lara; Fassi, Irene] CNR, Inst Intelligent Ind Technol & Syst Adv Mfg, STIIMA CNR, Milan, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Sistemi Tecnologie Industriali Intelligenti per il Manifatturiero Avanzato (STIIMA-CNR),"Patil, T (通讯作者)，CNR, Inst Intelligent Ind Technol & Syst Adv Mfg, STIIMA CNR, Milan, Italy.",,"fassi, irene/E-9648-2013; Rebaioli, Lara/S-2460-2016; Patil, Trunal/ACT-9847-2022",,European Union [814078],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work has been developed in the context of the H2020-MSCA-ITN DiManD project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the grant agreement no. 814078.,,25,0,0,0,1,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-8548-2,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,V011T11A016,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Manufacturing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BW9ZC,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001224373400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fossil fuels, commonly used for energy production, are costly and contribute to environmental pollution through greenhouse gas emissions. Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) offer a promising alternative due to their stability, low cost, and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to other third-generation solar cells. Kesterite materials, known for their excellent optoelectronic properties and chemical stability, have gained attention for their potential as hole transport layer (HTL) materials in solar cells. In this study, the SCAPS-1D numerical simulator was used to analyze a solar cell with the configuration FTO/TiO2/MoS2/HTL/Ag. The electron transport layer (ETL) used was titanium dioxide (TiO2), while Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTSe), Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS), and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSSe) kesterite materials were evaluated as HTLs.

Tvorchestvo had by this time become a key concept in Russian pre-revolutionary and later emigre thought. It is associated above all with Nikolai Berdyaev's philosophy, but it also plays an important role in Sergei Bulgakov's philosophy of economy. In both cases, it stands for the human response to divine creation. Moreover, and somewhat less famously, it was also an epistemological concept in the religious idealism of Vladimir Solovyov as well as in Russian neo-Kantianism (Fyodor Stepun), where it stood for the active, synthetic faculty of our minds. Florovsky, meanwhile, used it as a description of how we should relate to the patristic heritage, but also to history more generally: Our attitude should be creative, active, as well as both backward- and forward-looking. This return to the Fathers was a central component of Florovsky's neopatristic program, but, interestingly, in order to conceptualize this return, Florovsky took over a concept from traditions that his own approach otherwise firmly criticized. By analyzing Florovsky's use of tvorchestvo, this article addresses the broader question as to the differences and parallels between the neopatristic movement and the legacy of the Russian Renaissance (Silver Age).","[Mjor, Kare Johan] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Box 7030, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Mjor, Kare Johan] Univ Bergen, Box 7800, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of Bergen,"Mjor, KJ (通讯作者)，Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Box 7030, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.;Mjor, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Box 7800, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Kare.johan.mjor@hvl.no,"Mjør, Kåre/AAM-4684-2020",,Western Norway University Of Applied Sciences,Western Norway University Of Applied Sciences,Open access funding provided by Western Norway University Of Applied Sciences.,,39,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-9392,1573-0948,,STUD E EUR THOUGHT,Stud.

Dr. A. A. Forbes originally discovered minerals there in 1888. When it ceased operations in 1974, it had produced over 517,000 metric tonnes (mt) of copper, 125,000 mt of zinc, and significant quantities of lead, cadmium, silver, gold and pyrite. The mine applied and improved a froth-flotation system that was particularly efficient in separating and concentrating the ore: the Britannia deep-cell flotation system helped triple the yield at one of their mills. The steep local mountain slopes were used to generate hydroelectric power that provided compressed air for the mine ventilation system, and to transport ore through the concentrator by gravity. Old rails were recycled to make grinding balls for the mills, many years before recycling technology and the circular economy were recognized to be desirable practices. They used IBM punch cards for time keeping in 1929. The mine also leaves an environmental legacy, however, as one of the largest sources of metal pollution in North America. Remediation efforts to protect Howe Sound and the Squamish River from acid rock drainage will be necessary for the foreseeable future.","[Mahmood, Ali A.] Adv Studies Res Ctr, Drummondville, PQ, Canada; [Bartlett, F.

The foremost challenge is to develop innovative wastewater treatment technologies with low production cost and enhanced efficiency. Concomitantly, the role of nanotechnology in pollution remediation, drinking, and wastewater treatment has proven to be promising according to numerous pilot-scale, laboratory, and in situ studies. Remarkable nanoscale features, namely excellent adsorption properties, enhanced photocatalysis, and high reactivity, have fostered dynamic innovation globally. This review focuses on the state-of-art of treatment techniques with nano-based materials, for example graphene and carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticlessuch as silver, iron, zinc and magnesium, and metal oxide nanoparticles and magnetic-core composites including cobalt, nickel, and iron. Furthermore, we compareemerging and conventional technologies in terms of production cost and performance for both organic and inorganic pollutants.

The particular danger of inorganic pollutants arises from their persistent toxicity and inability to biodegrade. Recently, electrocoagulation (EC) has been demonstrated as an alternative sustainable approach to purifying wastewater due to the increasingly strict pollution prevention rules. In particular, EC has been used to remove inorganic pollutants, such as Cr, Zn, Pb, or As. EC has emerged as a sustainable tool for resource recovery of some inorganic pollutants such as N and P that, when recovered, have value as plant nutrients and are critical in a circular economy. These recovered materials can be obtained from diverse agricultural drainage water and recycled as fertilizers. In this work, a state-of-the-art technique is reviewed describing the advances in contaminant removal and nutrient recovery using EC through an in-depth discussion of the factors influencing the contaminant removal process, including operating pH, time, power, and concentration. Furthermore, limitations of the EC technology are reviewed, including the high-power consumption, fast deterioration of the sacrificial electrodes, and the types of contaminants that could not be efficiently removed. Finally, new emerging constructs in EC process optimization parameters are presented.","[Ammar, Mohamed; Baltrusaitis, Jonas] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Yousef, Ezz; Ashraf, Sherif] Suez Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, POB 43221, Suez, Egypt",Lehigh University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez University,"Baltrusaitis, J (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",moa422@lehigh.edu; ezzeldien.ymyo@sci.suezuni.edu.eg; sherif.hmhe@sci.suezuni.edu.eg; job314@lehigh.edu,"Baltrusaitis, Jonas/AAW-6072-2021; Yousef, Ezz/KPA-4425-2024; ashraf, Sherif/JOK-6296-2023","Ashraf, Sherif/0000-0003-3397-2642; Yousef, Ezz/0000-0001-6347-9256; Baltrusaitis, Jonas/0000-0001-5634-955X",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Engineering for Agricultural Production Systems program [2020-67022-31144],USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Engineering for Agricultural Production Systems program,"This work was supported by the Engineering for Agricultural Production Systems program, grant no. 2020-67022-31144, from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.",,214,2,2,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2297-8739,,SEPARATIONS,Separations,NOV,2024,11,11,,,,,,,320,10.3390/separations11110320,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/separations11110320,,,34,"Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,N7L9Y,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001366119800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Making the transfer beyond the context in which applications were originally conceptualized is challenging, as these have to be tailored towards local end-user needs and regulations. Such information is not always readily available, which risks successful uptake in novel settings. Living labs help to bridge this gap, by performing user experience research and supporting user-centred design for cross-border projects. Dissimilarities in recruitment and participation of end users could however influence study outcomes. Therefore, this study explores to what extent living labs are aware of potential cross-cultural differences. The sample consists of 36 living labs from 20 countries, most focusing on health and care, the silver economy and information technology. Regional differences are reported on participants' motivation and on the impact of gender, age, professional status and socio-economic status on participants' contribution. Awareness of potential differences during recruitment and grouping and supporting equal contribution in sessions could improve the quality of user-centred research in international contexts, while still maintaining sufficient standardisation. Further research with larger international samples is needed to replicate and extend these findings.","[De Witte, Nele A.

A number of modifications were investigated. Higher concentrations of serum and protein G-HRP at 1:5 to 1:10 and 1:100, respectively, increased the detection to the same order as that obtained with second antibody systems and gold staining with silver enhancement. The role of various detergents in the procedure was established. 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) in incubation with protein G-HRP increased the binding between protein G and immunoglobulin C. Addition of Tween-20 for blocking produced little background so that protein blockers could be avoided. Prolonged incubation with serum increased markedly the sensitivity of the procedure when compared with the recommended 2 h incubation period. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane provided better transfer effect, lower background and higher mechanical strength than nitrocellulose membrane. The utilization of only one antibody-specific ligand increased the simplicity, reliability, economy, efficiency and specificity of the method.

Solutions are urgently needed but their development and application are hampered by the complexity and scale of the issue. System dynamics is a technique used to understand complex behaviours of systems through model building and is useful for conceptualising the relationships between various interacting, dynamic factors, and identifying potential intervention points within the system where specific policies or innovations might have the greatest impact or meet with the greatest resistance. Here, twenty-five participants (all scientific researchers of various career stages, disciplines and nationalities working on plastic pollution) completed a series of exercises through an interactive, iterative group model building exercise during a one-day workshop. The process culminated in the generation of a causal loop diagram, based on participants' perspectives, illustrating the dynamic factors relating to the constraints and enablers of solutions to plastic pollution. A total of 18 factors and seven feedback loops were identified. Key factors influencing the system were Effective legislation, Funding, Public education and awareness, Behaviour change, Innovation, and Effective waste management. Our findings highlight that there is no single driver, or 'silver bullet', for resolving this complex issue and that a holistic approach should be adopted to create effective and systemic change.","[Morasae, E.

To achieve this aim, a qualitative study of a case study in Camden Market, London, United Kingdom was used. A sampling approach that used a non-random, snowball and purposive sampling led to 21 participants who were interviewed with open ended questions. This study found that some factors pertinent to mental, skills and usage access create a digital divide that leads to both positive and negative outcomes when using the AI Virtual Personal Assistants (VPAs) function of smartphones. In the positive outcomes, technoeustress emerged due to functions like, currency converters, language translation and weather forecasts. Negative outcomes included technostress where individuals did not understand the capabilities of VPAs.

North Carolina's gold production peaked between the 1830s and 1840s as hundreds of mines contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to the national economy, necessitating the 1837 construction of a federal Branch Mint in Charlotte to process Piedmont gold. Gold mining suffered a major decline in North Carolina after the discovery of the richer and more extensive gold deposits in California in 1848. However, the North Carolina gold miners who did not join the western rush continued to work the shafts of the Piedmont using increasingly sophisticated European and South American technology, as well as new innovations such as hydraulic mining techniques from California, until the advent of the Civil War.From the end of Reconstruction (1877) to 1920, gold mining in North Carolina was sporadic and often funded by outside investors or used as a ruse in gold and stock scams. Copper mining, with gold and silver as secondary products, using increasingly complex technology and associated environmental issues, drove most of the mining fervor during this period. Following the Great Depression of the 1930s, gold production slowly increased until the Second World War, but never became a major industry as they were out-competed by the more profitable gold fields in the western United States, Alaska, Canada, Australia, and South Africa.From the 1970s to today, dependent upon the price of gold in the market and the requirements of environmental regulation, prior mining districts in North (and South) Carolina have continued to be examined, explored and cautiously mined using cyanide heap leach techniques. Although few in number, these limited lease mining projects have extracted over two million troy ounces of gold and nearly a million troy ounces of silver by 2010. Future extraction by the ongoing Haile Mine (South Carolina) project will increase this amount substantially in the next decade. Nevertheless, Cabarrus County continues to hold the world's record for producing the greatest number of large (a pound or more) gold nuggets and was the epicenter of North America's first gold rush.","[Hines, Elizabeth; Smith, Michael] Univ N Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Smith, M (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",smithms@uncw.edu,,,,,,,96,0,0,3,7,HISTORY EARTH SCIENCES SOC,SHREWSBURY,"C/O DAVID I.

Natural-based extracts, especially olive leaf extracts, have been associated with the green economy not only as recycled agri-waste but also in the prevention and treatment of various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The aim of this work was to provide a comparison between the characteristics, biological activity, and gene expression of water extract of olive leaves (OLE), green synthesized OLE silver nanoparticles (OL/Ag-NPs), and OLE whey protein capsules (OL/WPNs) of the two olive varieties, Tofahy and Shemlali. The particles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared. The bioactive compounds of the preparations were evaluated for their antioxidant activity and anticancer effect on HCT-116 colorectal cells as well as for their regulatory effects on cytochrome C oxidase (Cox1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) genes. (OL/Ag-NPs) were found to be smaller than (OL/WPNs) with sizes of (37.46 +/- 1.85 and 44.86 +/- 1.62 nm) and (227.20 +/- 2.43 and 553.02 +/- 3.60 nm) for Tofahy and Shemlali, respectively. SEM showed that Shemlali (OL/Ag-NPs) had the least aggregation due to their highest Sigma-potential (-31.76 +/- 0.87 mV). The preparations were relatively nontoxic to Vero cells (IC50 = 151.94-789.25 mu g/mL), while they were cytotoxic to HCT-116 colorectal cells (IC50 = 77.54-320.64 mu g/mL). Shemlali and Tofahy OLE and Tofahy OL/Ag-NPs had a higher selectivity index (2.97-7.08 mu g/mL) than doxorubicin (2.36 mu g/mL), indicating promising anticancer activity. Moreover, Shemlali preparations regulated the expression of Cox1 (up-regulation) and TNF-alpha (down-regulation) on HCT-116 cells, revealing their efficiency in suppressing the expression of genes that promote cancer cell proliferation. (OL/Ag-NPs) from Tofahy and Shemlali were found to be more stable, effective, and safe than (OL/WPNs). Consequently, OL/Ag-NPs, especially Tofahy, are the best and safest nanoscale particles that can be safely used in food and pharmaceutical applications.","[Mansour, Hanem M.

Although these wastes contain valuable metals (e.g. Silver (Ag), Aluminum (Al), and Silicon (Si)), unfortunately there is currently no obvious strategy for recovery of these metals and landfilling is considered the primary option for their disposal what can lead to serious soil contamination and human health risks if the waste is not treated properly. This research aims to develop an integrated technology to recover all these metals as high added value nano/micro products with total recovery rate > 98%, thus achieving the sustainability and goals of circular economy. Milling process was used as a pretreatment to break the chemical and mechanical bonds between Ag electrodes, Al electrode, and Si layer of RSCW samples to increase the surface area for reaction. The pretreatment was followed by leaching process using Nitric Acid (HNO3) with concentration > 60% to dissolve Ag and break the chemical bonds between spherical Al microparticles in the Al paste layer. Thus the particles were separated and only a small amount of the Al was dissolved from the surface of the particles since due to the high concentration of HNO3 passivation of Al occurred, forming a thin layer from Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) that prevented the further dissolution of Al. Under the effect of soundwaves, the separated particles began splitting further and exfoliate into Al nanocrystals. After that, micro-filtration process was used to extract Si microparticles from the leached solution and the extracted particles were purified by etching process using Hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove Silicon Nitride contamination. Centrifugal process was used to separate Al nanocrystals from the leached solution. Finally, Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the remaining saturated solution to recover AgCl. SEM-EDS, FTIR, ICP, XRD, and TEM were used to analyze and examine the selected wafers and recovered materials. Also, the economic performance, sustainability, and CO2 emissions of the advanced technology were evaluated.","[Yousef, Samy] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn & Design, Dept Prod Engn, LT-51424 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Tatariants, Maksym] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Chem Technol, Dept Environm Technol, LT-50254 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Denafas, Julius; Kruopiene, Jolita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Gedinimo G 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Makarevicius, Vidas; Lukosiute, Stase-Irena] Lithuanian Energy Inst, Breslaujos 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Yousef, Samy] Akhbar Elyom Acad 6th Of October, Dept Prod Engn & Printing Technol, 6th Of October, Egypt",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology; Lithuanian Energy Institute,"Yousef, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn & Design, Dept Prod Engn, LT-51424 Kaunas, Lithuania.;Yousef, S (通讯作者)，Akhbar Elyom Acad 6th Of October, Dept Prod Engn & Printing Technol, 6th Of October, Egypt.",ahmed.saed@ktu.lt,"Yousef, Samy/F-1042-2016; Denafas, Julius/AAT-3088-2021; Tatariants, Maksym/O-4559-2019; Kruopienė, Jolita/AFW-3602-2022; Tatariants, Maksym/N-8353-2017","Tatariants, Maksym/0000-0002-5952-9801; Yousef, Samy/0000-0002-4846-3202; Kruopiene, Jolita/0000-0002-6191-9040; Makarevicius, Vidas/0000-0003-2402-2223; Lukosiute, Irena/0000-0002-3416-2206",,,,,49,37,38,2,55,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-0248,1879-3398,,SOL ENERG MAT SOL C,Sol.

However, few studies focus on uncovering the key determinants on the supply disruption of such ores. This study investigates the key determinants that influenced the disruption of 18 types of ores' production from 2010 to 2022 through the combination of web crawler, AI-text classification and manual processing methods. Results show that determinants such as politics, natural disasters, strikes and protests, economy, and energy, play crucial roles. Specifically, these determinants have different impacts in different countries and therefore require different policy designs, such as environmental protection policy (in China influencing Zinc, Tungsten, Molybdenum, and Iron), banning resource export (in Indonesia influencing Nickel and Tin), domestic risks (in Democratic Republic of Congo influencing Copper and Cobalt), extreme climate disasters (in Australia-influencing Iron, Aluminum, and Gold, and in Chile-influencing Copper and Lithium), natural disaster (in South Africa-influencing Chromium, Manganese, Platinum, Gold, and Fe, and in Chile-influencing Copper and Lithium), and strike and protests (in Peru-influencing Copper, Silver, and Zinc, and in South Africa-influencing Platinum and Gold). These findings can help stakeholders better prepare their strategies to improve the overall resilience of the entire ores supply chain and facilitate the global low carbon transition. Several policy recommendations are then proposed to improve sustainable supply of key minerals.","[Wang, Xibin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Tian, Xu; Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU UNIDO Joint Inst Inclus & Sustainable Ind Dev, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Tian, X; Geng, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU UNIDO Joint Inst Inclus & Sustainable Ind Dev, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",tianxu@sjtu.edu.cn; ygeng@sjtu.edu.cn,"Tian, Xu/AAX-7334-2020; Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018","Tian, Xu/0000-0003-3265-5725; Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375","National natural science foundation of China [72274120, 72088101]; National key research and development program [2019YFC1908500]",National natural science foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National key research and development program(National Key Research & Development Program of China),"This study is supported by the national natural science foundation of China (72274120, 72088101) and the national key research and development program (2019YFC1908500/01).

Thus, multifaceted solutions should be developed. Another challenge associated with the built environment is aging and a large economic burden to upgrade and maintain the outdated infrastructure. The current status of the U.S. built environment is far below sustainable condition. Rapidly deteriorating infrastructure that must be replaced provides us with the unique opportunity to rethink where and how we should live in the future. In addition, current challenges related to economic and societal inequality in the United States and other global communities also force us to re-evaluate how humanity is connected and how we share resources for a sustainable and healthy future while keeping the Earth safe.

Without starch, gold quasi-microspheres with diameters of 5-10 mu m become the dominant product as they also grow out of the flower-like nanostructures by filling gold atoms in the gaps between nano-petals. This starch-enable selective formation of large nanosheets is rapid and efficient as a 100% conversion could be attained even at a high concentration of gold ions (25.4 mM). A large-scale production of 2.5 g glittering gold nanosheets with a 5-L batch 10 h synthesis was demonstrated. The synthetic protocol was not only achieving atomic economy using an environmental friendly reducing reagent and renewable stabilizer, the mass-scale production prototype was accomplished at room temperature without a need for extensive waste treatment. The slightly acidic starch solution obtained after the reaction was recycled for the next synthesis or neutralized before discharging.","[Nootchanat, Supeera; Thammacharoen, Chuchaat; Ekgasit, Sanong] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Sensor Res Unit, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Lohwongwatana, Boonrat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Engn, Met Engn Dept, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Chulalongkorn University,"Nootchanat, S (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Sensor Res Unit, 254 Phyathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",sanong.e@chula.ac.th,,"Lohwongwatana, Boonrat/0000-0002-3131-8076","National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT); Thailand Research Fund (TRF); Chulalongkorn University Centenary Academic Development Project (Under the Center of Innovative Nanotechnology, Chulalongkorn University); Commission of Higher Education (CHE); Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents (DPST) Project","National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)(National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)); Thailand Research Fund (TRF)(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); Chulalongkorn University Centenary Academic Development Project (Under the Center of Innovative Nanotechnology, Chulalongkorn University); Commission of Higher Education (CHE)(Office of Higher Education Commission (OHEC)); Development and Promotion of Science and Technology Talents (DPST) Project","The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Thailand Research Fund (TRF), Chulalongkorn University Centenary Academic Development Project (Under the Center of Innovative Nanotechnology, Chulalongkorn University), and Commission of Higher Education (CHE).

The green biotechnology of mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus L.) includes the myco-remediation of polluted soil and water as well as bio-fermentation. The circular economy approach could be effectively achieved by using oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus L.), of which the substrate of their cultivation is considered as a vital source for producing biofertilizers, animal feeds, bioenergy, and bio-remediators. Spent mushroom substrate is also considered a crucial source for many applications, including the production of enzymes (e.g., manganese peroxidase, laccase, and lignin peroxidase) and bioethanol. The sustainable management of agro-industrial wastes (e.g., plant-based foods, animal-based foods, and non-food industries) could reduce, reuse and recycle using oyster mushrooms. This review aims to focus on the biotechnological applications of the oyster mushroom (P. ostreatus L.) concerning the field of the myco-remediation of pollutants and the bio-fermentation of agro-industrial wastes as a sustainable approach to environmental protection.

Visible and invisible inclusions consist of Ag-Au-Te sulfosalt and monazite-(La) particles. Trace metal concentrations grade up to 24,000 g/t for cobalt, up to 4000 g/t for lanthanum, and up to 4 g/t for gold. Pyrite, considered a waste material, is removed from the valuable copper ore material and sent to the tailings. Thus, tailings with high contents of pyrite can represent a prime target to explore for critical metals in the porphyry copper mining operations, transforming it into a new source of supply for critical metals. We propose that high-resolution mineral characterization is the key to evolve from a quasi-single-metal (copper) operation to a multi-metals business by developing metal-selective mining. To address this challenge, we coined the Metal-Zone concept to identify zones enriched in a specific metal within a mineral deposit, instead of zones enriched in an ore mineral.","[Velasquez, German; Carrizo, Daniel] Univ Chile, AMTC, FCFM, Santiago 8370451, Chile; [Salvi, Stefano] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Geosci Environm Toulouse GET, GET,IRD,OMP, 14 Ave Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Vela, Ivan; Pablo, Marcial; Perez, Agustin] Anglo Amer Chile, Los Bronces Underground Project, Superintendence Geol, Santiago 7550103, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Velásquez, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, AMTC, FCFM, Santiago 8370451, Chile.",german.velasquez@amtc.uchlie.cl; daniel.carrizo@amtc.cl; stefano.salvi@get.omp.eu; ivan.vela@angloamerican.com; marcial.pablof@angloamerican.com; agustin.perez@angloamerican.com,"Velasquez, German/AFP-4968-2022; Carrizo, Daniel/M-9322-2019; Salvi, Stefano/U-6231-2017","Salvi, Stefano/0000-0003-4962-0668; Velasquez, German/0000-0002-8124-6509; Carrizo, Daniel/0000-0002-7205-7693",,,,,34,10,11,3,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,FEB,2020,10,2,,,,,,,109,10.3390/min10020109,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min10020109,,,17,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,KY3EB,,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000522452900024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Generally, several reagents including precursors, reducing agents, stabilizing agents and solvents are used for the production of NPs and in some cases, energy is needed to reach the optimum temperature for reduction. Therefore, to develop a green approach, researchers had the opportunity to investigate eco-friendly reagents and new energy transfer techniques. In order to substitute the harmful reagents with green ones, researchers worked on different types of saccharides, polyols, carboxylic acids, polyoxometalates and extracts of various plants that can play the role of reducers, stabilizers or solvents. Also, there are some reports on using ultraviolet (UV), gamma and microwave irradiation that are capable of reducing and provide uniform heating. According to the literature, it is possible to use green reagents and novel energy transfer techniques for production of NPs. However, these new synthesis routes should be optimized in terms of performance, cost, product quality (shape and size distribution) and scale-up capability. This paper presents a review on most of the employed green reagents and new energy transfer techniques for the production of metallic NPs.","[Naghdi, Mitra; Taheran, Mehrdad; Brar, Satinder K.; Valero, J.

Recently developed trimetallic ruthenium-potassium-promoter (RuKM) ammonia decomposition catalysts have exceptionally low ammonia decomposition temperatures, able to perform the decomposition as low as 250 degrees C, which is significantly lower than other known catalysts that require temperatures above 500 degrees C. However, the effects of the RuKM precursor on the catalytic activity have not been investigated. We report the observed differences of 3% ruthenium/12% potassium/1% yttrium (RuKY) catalysts on gamma-alumina synthesized from chloride-, nitrate-, and acetate-based precursors. Catalysts synthesized from chloride-based precursors demonstrated the lowest ammonia decomposition catalytic activity at lower reaction temperatures. In contrast, those synthesized from nitrate-based precursors demonstrated the highest yield, despite similar metal loading. This difference in reactivity is most apparent between 250 and 400 degrees C, as the conversion rates of the catalysts synthesized with chloride-free precursors are up to 50% greater than those synthesized with chloride precursors. The observed differences in catalytic activity were much less apparent above 450 degrees C. The observed activation energies of the catalysts were independent of the precursor utilized, despite the difference in catalytic activity, suggesting that the active site composition was the same for all catalysts. These results suggest a pathway to improved ammonia cracking catalysts by tailoring the precursor used in the synthesis.","[Koch, Christopher J.; Naglic, Jennifer; Clairmonte, Daniel; Rai, Binod; Angelette, Lucas M.; Guin, Tyler] Savannah River Natl Lab, Hydrogen Isotope Proc Sci, Aiken, SC 29803 USA; [Kearney, Logan] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Lauterbach, Jochen] Univ South Carolina, Dept Chem Engn, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Savannah River National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Guin, T (通讯作者)，Savannah River Natl Lab, Hydrogen Isotope Proc Sci, Aiken, SC 29803 USA.",tylercguin@gmail.com,"Kearney, Logan/AAB-9250-2020; Naglic, Jennifer/KRQ-9160-2024","Koch, Christopher/0000-0003-0565-6853",U.S. Department of Energy; Tritium Modernization Program [89303321CEM000080]; National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Strategic Materials Production Modernization; U.S. Department of Energy,U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Tritium Modernization Program; National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Strategic Materials Production Modernization; U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Tritium Modernization Program, sponsored by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Strategic Materials Production Modernization.

To provide a sufficient and consistent food supply, it is necessitated to use productive and efficient agriculture practices. Nanotechnology dispensed a revolutionary approach to agronomy by enhancing the accessibility of metal ions to the plants. The high surface area-to-volume ratio and compact size of nanoparticles allow them to efficiently improve the nutrient uptake by plants. Micronutrient salts used in conventional fertilizers generally disrupt soil pH balance, a nutrient availability that potentially harms plant health. Also, overutilization of these salts leads to nutrient imbalances or antagonistic interactions with other nutrients and harms the surrounding ecosystems. Interestingly, bio-extract-based metal nanoparticles are intended to support sustainable agricultural practices. Plant, fungal, and bacterial extracts, which are utilized in nano-fertilizers, contain active substances, including phytochemicals, aromatic compounds, vitamins, and minerals. These compounds aid in promoting growth which could benefit the wellbeing and output of plants. Further, nanoparticles can also help to improve soil fertility and slowdown soil deterioration by retaining nutrients, water, and soil structure. This review examines the potential of nanoparticles as an alternative micronutrient source, exploring on several metallic nano-fertilizers and advocating their eco-friendly approach to enhance agricultural practices on food crops.","[Shashidhara, Vaishnavi; Bhattacharjee, Surjit; Alwarsamy, Madhavarani] JAIN Deemed Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, JC Rd, Bangalore 560027, Karnataka, India",Jain University,"Alwarsamy, M (通讯作者)，JAIN Deemed Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Chem & Biochem, JC Rd, Bangalore 560027, Karnataka, India.",a.madhavarani@jainuniversity.ac.in,"Alwarsamy, Madhavarani/AAM-5934-2020",,,,,,73,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0010-3624,1532-2416,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

However, despite the outstanding progress, their uptake on a web scale has been significantly less than initially anticipated due to higher usage thresholds. For instance, it is a hard task for service provider to seek appropriate semantic information such as OWL ontologies for service annotation in the service publication stage due to the fact that nowadays we are suffering from serious lack of available and ubiquitous ontologies for global consensus. Also it is not realistic for query users who do not possess much semantic knowledge to specify their requests with associated semantic information in the service discovery stage. In this paper, we propose a methodology to build a global social service network based on Link data principles for reducing the using thresholds. First, we propose Linked social service which is published on the open web by following Linked data principles with social link, and then we suggest a new platform for constructing a global social service network based on Linked social service. Then, an approach is proposed to enable exploitation of global social service network, providing Linked Social Service as a Service. Finally, experimental results show that the Linked social service can reduce the using threshold by enabling exploring service to service based on the global social service network.","[Chen, Wuhui; Paik, Incheon] Univ Aizu, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan",University of Aizu,"Chen, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Aizu, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan.",chenwuhui21@gmail.com; paikic@u-aizu.ac.jp,,,,,,,23,18,18,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3326,1572-9419,,INFORM SYST FRONT,Inf.

This research mainly discusses the construction of a network information security platform based on artificial intelligence for the elderly's health integration of physical, medical, and nursing care. The platform consists of five modules: health records, follow-up plans, remote training, health education, and remote consultation. Each module is equipped with a corresponding main interface and/or subinterface. Some modules also have submodules as needed. The structure is reasonable, and the interface is displayed. The combined medical care service model is divided into medical care, care care, and medical care. Among them, the medical care model mainly provides long-term comprehensive care services for the disabled, demented, semidisabled, and other elderly groups. The support-oriented model is mainly for self-care or semi-self-care elderly groups, providing rehabilitation monitoring and life care services.

In fact, the concentration of valuable precious and base metals in WPCBs is even higher compared to those found in mined ores. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to selectively extract precious metals with low concentrations from the pregnant leaching solution, due to the co-deposition of base metals, like Cu, which have higher concentrations. In this research, stepwise recovery of precious metals and copper directly from WPCBs thiosulfate leaching solution was facilitated by the Ti cathode coated with MoS2 (MoS2/Ti). The in-situ enrichment of Au(S2O3)(2)(3-) and Ag(S2O3)(2)(3-) at the surface of MoS2 enables the high efficiency and selectivity of electrodeposition, which has been confirmed through COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and visualization. As a result, the first-step electrodeposition at 0.6 V recovered 92.44 % Au and 98.18 % Ag without any co-deposition of Cu. Subsequently, the second-step recovery employed a constant current of 0.03 A, achieving 100 % recovery of copper within 12 h. Furthermore, this study optimized the reduction potential, NH3 center dot H2O concentration, and S2O32- concentration for the stepwise electrodeposition process. These findings provide valuable insights for establishing a closed loop circular economy in the electronics industry.","[Wang, Deshou; Liang, Yumeng; Zeng, Yong; Liu, Chang; Chen, Peng; Song, Shaoxian; Jia, Feifei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Key Lab Green Utilizat Crit Nonmet Mineral Resourc, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Deshou; Liang, Yumeng; Zeng, Yong; Liu, Chang; Chen, Peng; Song, Shaoxian; Jia, Feifei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Chun] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Met & Ecol Engn, Dept Energy Storage Sci & Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Ministry of Education - China; Wuhan University of Technology; University of Science & Technology Beijing,"Chen, P; Jia, FF (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Key Lab Green Utilizat Crit Nonmet Mineral Resourc, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",peng141592@163.com; feifeijia@whut.edu.cn,"Song, Shaoxian/AGX-4949-2022; 贾, 菲菲/AGZ-5771-2022; 梁, 广源/JUW-1816-2023",,,,,,46,21,21,47,129,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3894,1873-3336,,J HAZARD MATER,J.

In this view, the efficient recovery of metals from WEEE will allow a secure supply of raw materials and will contribute to a circular economy. Among many factors currently affecting the contribution of recycling, is the lack of suitable technologies for WEEE treatment in an environmentally friendly way. Current trends in eco-friendly technologies applied for gold, silver, copper, and tin recovery by electrowinning are reviewed in this paper. In addition, a case study on the perspectives of tin electrowinning has been evaluated. Tin can be present in rather high quantities in WEEE; moreover, its price is about three times higher than that for copper. The electrorecovery of tin has been carried out in cooperation with JSC Elektronikos perdirbimo technologijos. The eco-friendly process based on electrowinning from citric acid-containing leachates is elaborated. The citrate-based solutions have been chosen because citric acid is considered to be an environmentally friendly component. A high deposition rate and current efficiency have been achieved at a deposition potential -0.85 V at 60 degrees C. However, additional steps would be beneficial to diminish the interference of metals present in the scraps, such as Pb(II) and Cu(II), on tin electrorecovery.","[Cesiulis, Henrikas; Tsyntsaru, Natalia] Vilnius Univ, Dept Phys Chem, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Cesiulis, Henrikas] JSC Elekt Perdirbimo Technol, LT-06140 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Tsyntsaru, Natalia] Moldova State Univ, Inst Appl Phys, MD-2028 Kishinev, Moldova",Vilnius University; Moldova State University,"Cesiulis, H; Tsyntsaru, N (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Phys Chem, LT-03225 Vilnius, Lithuania.;Cesiulis, H (通讯作者)，JSC Elekt Perdirbimo Technol, LT-06140 Vilnius, Lithuania.;Tsyntsaru, N (通讯作者)，Moldova State Univ, Inst Appl Phys, MD-2028 Kishinev, Moldova.",henrikas.cesiulis@chf.vu.lt; ashra_nt@yahoo.com,"; Tintaru, Natalia/JHU-2913-2023","Cesiulis, Henrikas/0000-0002-5077-7884; Tintaru, Natalia/0000-0002-9813-2460","Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under MSCA-RISE-2017, project SMARTELECTRODES [778357]; National Agency for Research and Development Moldova [20.80009.5007.18]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [778357] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)","Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under MSCA-RISE-2017, project SMARTELECTRODES; National Agency for Research and Development Moldova; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions)","This research has received funding from Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under MSCA-RISE-2017, project SMARTELECTRODES No. 778357, and partially was supported by the National Agency for Research and Development Moldova, within the project No. 20.80009.5007.18",,40,7,7,5,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6412,,COATINGS,Coatings,MAR,2023,13,3,,,,,,,574,10.3390/coatings13030574,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/coatings13030574,,,11,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science; Physics,C0UK0,,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000959171600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study employed different advanced statistical techniques, including generalized method of moments and fully generalized least square for testing the hypotheses. At the same time, the study also adopted Dumitrescu Hurlin Panel Causality test to the cause-effect relationship between the endogenous and exogenous variables. The findings revealed that green supply chain management practices are much useful to improve environmental sustainability through a reduction in carbon emissions and PM2.5, which further correlated with a reduction in the pollution-related mortality rates. Also, the results indicate that green supply chain practices spur economic growth in terms of providing trade opportunities around the globe particularly in pro-environmentalist countries without any non-tariff barriers/penalties and attract foreign investors due to green policies. In our best of knowledge, in the literature review, none of the research conducted on GSCM practices and Macro-level indicators, this study will assist both policymakers and practitioners to understand the holistic role of GSCM practices to greening the economy and provide a framework to develop game-changing environmental policies in the context of cross-border supply chain and trade.","[Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman] Xuzhou Univ Technol, Sch Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhang] Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Sharif, Arshian] Univ Utara, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business, Changlun, Malaysia; [Sharif, Arshian] ILMA Univ, Dept Business Adm, Karachi, Pakistan",Xuzhou University of Technology; Chang'an University; Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Khan, SAR (通讯作者)，Xuzhou Univ Technol, Sch Engn & Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sarehman_cscp@yahoo.com; Zhangyu19@foxmail.com; arshian.aslam@gmail.com,"KHAN, SYED ABDUL REHMAN/M-2213-2015; Yu, Zhang/AFV-9605-2022; Sharif, Arshian/I-4221-2016","Sharif, Arshian/0000-0002-1155-4151; khan, syed abdul rehman/0000-0001-5197-2318","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660700]; Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modelling, Capital University of Economics and Business [MCR2019QN09]","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modelling, Capital University of Economics and Business","This work supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019M660700); the Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modelling, Capital University of Economics and Business (No. MCR2019QN09).",,101,77,77,11,64,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

It involves the production, manipulation and application of materials ranging in size from less than a micron to that of individual atoms. The reactivity and absorption level of nanomaterial is more than bulk material due to large surface area and high particle number per unit mass. While metal nanoparticles are being increasingly used in many sectors of the economy, there is growing interest to find out the best biological and environmentally safe methods for their production. The basic methods for nanoparticles production are chemical and physical approaches, whereas plant extract and different microorganisms have been actively pursued in recent years as an alternative method. The application of nanotechnology in agriculture system will completely revolutionize it. This technology includes different tools for disease treatment and detection and can be used as sensors, fertilizers and smart delivery system in gene transfer. The other side of this technology cannot be neglected because its application on the large scale has potential adverse effects on biological and other systems.

Metals play a crucial role in stabilizing the collagen matrix at different stages of leather processing. They also aid in imparting important properties to leathers at the respective stage leading to the enhancement of the end product. The current review critically analyses the role of different metals like chromium, aluminum, titanium and metallic nanocomposites in different unit operations of leather processing. Each metal/ metallic nanocomposite has its own set of advantages and limitations in different dimensions including imparting properties to leathers at the appropriate stage of the process, in terms of availability and extent of environmental hazard. Further, metallic nanocomposites either standalone or in combination with suitable compounds/ extracts are found to have potential applications in the fabrication of good quality leathers and in imparting superior properties like antimicrobial and thermal stability properties.

In this work, we demonstrate that the vast profusion of alloys, and the complexities and miniaturization of modern electronics, render functional recycling almost impossible. This situation is particularly true of spice metals: metals employed at very low concentrations to realize modest performance improvements in advanced alloys or complex electronics such as smartphones or laptops. Here, we present a formal definition of spice metals and explore the significant challenges that product design decisions impose on the recycling industry. We thereby identify nine spice metals: scandium (Sc), vanadium (V), gallium (Ga), arsenic (As), niobium (Nb), antimony (Sb), tellurium (Te), erbium (Er), and hafnium (Hf). These metals are considered fundamental for the properties they provide, yet they are rarely recycled. Their routine use poses severe problems for the implementation of closed material loops and the circular economy. Based on the data and discussions in this paper, we recommend that spice metals be employed only where their use will result in a highly significant improvement, and that product designers place a strong emphasis on enabling the functional recycling of these metals after their first use.","[Graedel, Thomas E.; Miatto, Alessio] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Graedel, TE (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",thomas.graedel@yale.edu; alessio.miatto@yale.edu,"Miatto, Alessio/R-9972-2019","Graedel, Thomas E/0000-0002-4007-3189; Miatto, Alessio/0000-0001-7541-9330",,,,,94,16,16,3,27,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,13,,,,,,,7535,10.3390/su14137535,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14137535,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,2T0AI,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000822145500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite a large number of diverse tourism resources in the country, tourism development was highly uneven, concentrating in a limited number of regions. Information technology and especially the Internet has greatly toughened global competition over tourist flows. In today's world, tourists would rather visit a place about which they can get sufficient information and where a trip can be easily arranged. The role of national and regional tourist web portals, supported by relevant government agencies, is significantly increasing in this context. The tourist information infrastructure should not only provide up-to-date and complete information, but also ensure usability for the tourist (including independent). Tourism within St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region is featured by rather close links between the regions and unification of tourist flows between them. Both regions have a significant quantity of tourist resources, which ensures development of various types of tourism. Creation of the 'Silver Necklace' interregional route consolidated further integration between tourist resources of the neighboring regions.

Different from previous studies, we examine the relationship between GPR and natural resource prices from the perspective of time-varying dynamics and time-frequency analysis. The correlations and risk spillover are measured through Empirical Mode Decomposition, TVP Coefficient of Rank Correlation and TVP-Copula-CoVaR model. The results show that GPR have time-varying and heterogeneous characteristics on the volatility of different natural resource prices. First, high frequency component has a stronger impact than the low frequency component. The short-term impact of GPR on natural resource prices is stronger than the long-term. Second, there is a stronger correlation between gold and silver. Crude oil and natural gas markets are more closely related. GPR have a positive relationship with precious metals and crude oil prices. The position of natural gas in the energy market has been significantly improved. GPR have a negative effect on common metal and natural gas. Third, the increase of GPR has significantly affected the stability of the market and intensified the risk spillover of the natural resource prices. Finally, there are asymmetric upside and downside risk spillovers among natural resource markets. The downside risk spillovers of high frequency and low frequency components are more significant.","[Li, Songsong; Zhang, Weiqian] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Sichuan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Sichuan University,"Zhang, W (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.",lisongsong@hit.edu.cn; zwq96hit@stu.hit.edu.cn; hbue_wb@163.com,"Li, Songsong/HLP-5261-2023; Zhang, Wei/AAA-6273-2022","Zhang, Weiqian/0000-0001-6955-2231",Late Funded Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [22FGLB026]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773024]; Youth Outstanding Talent Cultivation Program of Sichuan University [SKSYL2022-05],Late Funded Project of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Outstanding Talent Cultivation Program of Sichuan University,This work is supported by 'Late Funded Project of National Social Science Foundation of China' (Grant No. 22FGLB026) ; 'National Natural Science Foundation of China' (Grant No. 71773024) ; Youth Outstanding Talent Cultivation Program of Sichuan University (SKSYL2022-05) .,,82,28,28,18,104,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

Still, as an amalgamation of precious and rare raw materials, electronic waste is a considerable economic resource with the most valuable components located on the printed circuit boards. Gold is widely used in electronics in numerous applications, although principally for contact points and external connectors. The recovery of gold, due to its high value, is one of the main motivations for recycling e-waste. Although pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processing are still the preferred modes of recovery for gold, the use of high-energy consuming pyro-methods, and the use of gold cyanidation that uses harmful lixiviants are increasingly discouraged. Thiourea has received attention as an alternative lixiviant for gold leaching due to its fast reaction kinetics and less harmful nature. This review aims to provide an up-to-date evaluation of thiourea-gold leaching studies from electronic waste, with emphasis on the recent progression from the classic chemical method to a more sustainable hybrid bioleaching-based system, while its challenges are highlighted. The complementary methods applied for gold retrieval from the pregnant solution are also described with a focus on sustainable methods that have the potential to provide a closed-loop system, the key objective for material recovery in a circular economy.","[Ray, Daniel A.; Baniasadi, Mahsa; Graves, John E.; Farnaud, Sebastien] Coventry Univ, Bioleaching Grp, Ctr Sport Exercise & Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Graves, John E.] Coventry Univ, IFTC, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Greenwood, Alan] Coventry Univ, Fac Hlth & Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ray, Daniel A.; Baniasadi, Mahsa] Network 2 Supplies N2S Ltd, Network House,Western Way,Bury St Edmunds, Bury St Edmunds IP33 3SP, Suffolk, England",Coventry University; Coventry University; Coventry University,"Ray, DA (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Bioleaching Grp, Ctr Sport Exercise & Life Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Ray, DA (通讯作者)，Network 2 Supplies N2S Ltd, Network House,Western Way,Bury St Edmunds, Bury St Edmunds IP33 3SP, Suffolk, England.",rayd2@uni.coventry.ac.uk,"Farnaud, Sebastien/AAL-5551-2020","Ray, Daniel/0000-0001-5290-9150; Farnaud, Sebastien/0000-0003-2077-5797; Graves, John/0000-0002-2244-7802",Network 2 Supplies Limited,Network 2 Supplies Limited,The authors would like to thank Network 2 Supplies Limited for co-funding Daniel Ray's PhD,,85,38,38,20,96,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-3823,2199-3831,,J SUSTAIN METALL,J.

The most important tree species are beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), oak species (Quercus sp.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), poplars and willows (Populus L. sp., Salix L. sp.), and other hardwood broadleaves. Sources of pollution in the country, and emissions from neighbouring countries have resulted in a heavily polluted environment in some regions. Forest health monitoring data on environmental pollution from 1987 to 1994 that use forest ecosystem stability as the ecological criterion indicate that forest health in Slovakia has been adversely affected by air pollution. Average defoliation varies from 26 to 30% for all species. Defoliation for coniferous species is 27 to 35% and for broadleaves 19 to 27%. However, defoliation and foliage discoloration of trees, especially of conifers, have been reduced in recent years. These trends may be related to changes in the economy in central European countries in which the decrease of industrial activity has resulted in the decrease of pollution load. In contrary, high percentage of salvage cut (about 60% of the total annual cut) indicates serious ecological instability and impaired health status of Slovakian forests.

However, the continuous extraction of these metals is leading to a rapid decline in their ore grades and, consequently, increasing the environmental impact of extraction. Hence, obtaining metals from secondary sources, such as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), has become imperative for both environmental sustainability and ensuring their availability. To evaluate the sustainability of the process, this paper proposes using an exergy approach, which enables appropriate allocation among co-products, as well as the assessment of exergy losses and the use of non-renewable resources. As a case study, this paper analyzes the recycling process of waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) by disaggregating the exergy cost into renewable and non-renewable sources, employing different exergy-based cost allocation methods for the mentioned metals. It further considers the complete life cycle of metals using the Circular Thermoeconomics methodology. The results show that, when considering the entire life cycle, between 47% and 53% of the non-renewable exergy is destroyed during recycling. Therefore, delaying recycling as much as possible would be the most desirable option for minimizing the use of non-renewable resources.","[Torrubia, Jorge; Torres, Cesar; Valero, Alicia; Valero, Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Res Inst Energy & Resource Efficiency Aragon Energ, Campus Rio Ebro,Mariano Esquillor Gomez,15, Zaragoza 50018, Spain; [Torrubia, Jorge; Parvez, Ashak Mahmud; Sajjad, Mohsin; Paz, Felipe Garcia] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf e V HZDR, Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol HIF, Chemnitzer Str 40, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",University of Zaragoza,"Torrubia, J; Torres, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Res Inst Energy & Resource Efficiency Aragon Energ, Campus Rio Ebro,Mariano Esquillor Gomez,15, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.;Torrubia, J (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf e V HZDR, Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol HIF, Chemnitzer Str 40, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany.",jtorrubia@unizar.es; ctorresc@unizar.es; aliciavd@unizar.es; valero@unizar.es; a.parvez@hzdr.de; m.sajjad@hzdr.de; felipe18_93@hotmail.com,"Torres, César/AAR-9641-2020; Valero, Antonio/AAL-7379-2021; Delgado, Alicia/Z-6141-2019","Torrubia, Jorge/0000-0001-9282-1428; Sajjad, Mohsin/0000-0001-8910-5471; Torres Cuadra, Cesar/0000-0002-6360-1159; Valero Delgado, Alicia/0000-0003-3330-1793","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; RESTORE project; Horizon Europe project REDOL [101091668]; [PID2023-148401OB-I00]; Horizon Europe - Pillar II [101091668] Funding Source: Horizon Europe - Pillar II","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(Spanish Government); RESTORE project; Horizon Europe project REDOL; ; Horizon Europe - Pillar II(European Union (EU)Horizon Europe - Pillar II)","This research was funded by RESTORE project granted by Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (grant number PID2023-148401OB-I00) and Horizon Europe project REDOL (Grant Agreement 101091668).",,49,2,2,9,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,OCT,2024,17,19,,,,,,,4973,10.3390/en17194973,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17194973,,,22,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,I7S8J,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001332227600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With this ageing comes an accumulation of cellular changes that lead to the development of diseases and susceptibility to infections. This impacts not only the health system, but also the global economy. As the population increases, so does the demand for energy and the emission of pollutants, leading to a progressive degradation of our environment. This in turn impacts health through reduced access to arable land, clean water, and breathable air. New monitoring approaches to assist in environmental control and minimize the impact on health are urgently needed, leading to the development of new sensor technologies that are highly sensitive, rapid, and low-cost. Nanopore sensing is a new technology that helps to meet this purpose, with the potential to provide rapid point-of-care medical diagnosis, real-time on-site pollutant monitoring systems to manage environmental health, as well as integrated sensors to increase the efficiency and storage capacity of renewable energy sources. In this review we discuss how the powerful approach of nanopore based single-molecule, or particle, electrical promises to overcome existing and emerging societal challenges, providing new opportunities and tools for personalized medicine, localized environmental monitoring, and improved energy production and storage systems.","[Tanimoto, Izadora Mayumi Fujinami; Bacri, Laurent; Pelta, Juan] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Evry, CNRS, LAMBE, F-91025 Evry, France; [Tanimoto, Izadora Mayumi Fujinami; Le Pioufle, Bruno] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, ENS Paris Saclay, Inst Alembert,LuMIn, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cressiot, Benjamin; Pelta, Juan] CY Cergy Paris Univ, CNRS, LAMBE, F-95000 Cergy, France; [Greive, Sandra J.] DreamPore SAS, 33 Blvd Port, F-95000 Cergy, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Bacri, L; Pelta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Evry, CNRS, LAMBE, F-91025 Evry, France.;Cressiot, B; Pelta, J (通讯作者)，CY Cergy Paris Univ, CNRS, LAMBE, F-95000 Cergy, France.",benjamin.cressiot@cyu.fr; laurent.bacri@univ-evry.fr; juan.pelta@univ-evry.fr,"Tanimoto, Izadora/AAK-4999-2020; Le Pioufle, Bruno/B-6951-2013; Cressiot, Benjamin/KFR-0696-2024","Cressiot, Benjamin/0000-0001-9319-3152; Greive, Sandra/0000-0001-6067-2632",DIM Respore; Region Ile de France; ANR Epsilomics [17-CE09-0044-02]; CY Initiative of Excellence [ANR-16-IDEX-0008]; Reseau sur le Stockage Electrochimique de l' Energie [RS2E],DIM Respore; Region Ile de France(Region Ile-de-France); ANR Epsilomics(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); CY Initiative of Excellence; Reseau sur le Stockage Electrochimique de l' Energie,"We acknowledge financial support from DIM Respore, Region Ile de France (PhD grants), ANR Epsilomics (No. 17-CE09-0044-02), CY Initiative of Excellence (Investissements d'Avenir No. ANR-16-IDEX-0008), and Reseau sur le Stockage Electrochimique de l' Energie (RS2E).",,190,25,26,8,57,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"B605D, XUE YAN BUILDING, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",1998-0124,1998-0000,,NANO RES,Nano Res.,NOV,2022,15,11,,,SI,,9906,9920,,10.1007/s12274-022-4379-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-022-4379-2,,MAY 2022,15,"Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,5F9WI,35610982,Green Published,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000799545100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gold mining can be highly resource-intensive, due to the need for selective gold separations from dilute streams, in the presence of multi-component metallic species. The development of efficient gold separation technologies is critical to mitigate the declining gold purity in mined ores and to meet the need for electronic waste recycling. We propose a modular electrochemical separation platform via metallopolymer-functionalized electrodes to selec-tively recover and concentrate gold from electronic waste and simulated mining streams. Polyvinylferrocene (PVF) redox-electrodes captured cyano-gold with 10-fold higher uptake (>200 mg/g) than conventional activated carbon and, importantly, demonstrated an exceptional separation factor >20 for gold vs competing metals in mining and electronic waste, including silver, copper, nickel, and iron. Rapid gold uptake was observed within 5 min, and electrochemically mediated release and concentration achieved a remarkable up-concentration ratio of 20:1. Electrochemical recycling of gold from real-world electronic waste (e.g., RAM boards) highlighted our system as a drop-in replacement for activated carbon sorbent, with a recovery efficiency 99% and superior technoeconomics, leading to a 94% cost reduction and over 90% final gold purity. Redox-mediated electrochemical separations can be a promising avenue for the energy-efficient, sustainable, and process-intensified gold recovery and recycling.","[Cotty, Stephen R.; Kim, Nayeong; Su, Xiao] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Su, X (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,"Su, Xiao/0000-0001-7794-290X","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences Separations Science program [DE-SC0021409]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0021409] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences Separations Science program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences Separations Science program, under Award Number DE-SC0021409.",,53,27,27,19,69,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

However, up till now companies have been rather cautious in taking decisive steps in facilitating an innovation-based transition towards a low-carbon economy. This paper conceptually explores some key challenges related to innovating for climate change, in the broader context of technological change, complementary capability development and sociotechnical systems, to point to trade-offs to be made by companies. We adopt a firm-level perspective to discuss (a) how companies strike a balance between further development and deployment of emissions-reducing technologies, in view of the fact that there is no 'silver bullet' solution for climate change yet, (b) how and in what way low-carbon solutions are brought to the market, by targeting consumers in either mainstream markets or niche markets, and (c) to what extent the success or failure of climate change innovations depends on companies' bargaining power and willingness to cooperate with others. The paper shows how several industry-and firm-specific factors - technological dynamism, complementarity between new technologies and existing assets, and ownership of specialized assets for commercialization -influence how companies strike a balance between the different trade-offs and deal with the uncertainty created by the current 'climate policy deadlock'.

Dosage forms included were film-coated tablets, uncoated tablets, uncoated caplet shaped tablets and dispersible tablets which are prescribed for their specific therapeutic activity. Results: This research work has revealed quality issues of minor, major and critical types. These defects were unique in nature and appeared to be stray incidents which were not available even in standard textbooks or literature. Conclusion: Medicines being the silver sword to treat an ailment in a patient, it should not involve any quality issues leading to a significant impact on the safety and efficacy of the prescribed drug.

In particular, this method has been well applied to spatially defined units, such as a production plant, a treatment facility, and a contaminated site. However, the management strategies based on the risk information will be more efficient if the comprehensive picture of total risks from all kinds of sources is depicted. In principle, the total risks can be obtained when all risk sources are assessed individually. Apparently, this approach demands huge amount of efforts. This study develops a methodology that combines substance flow and risk estimation to facilitate examination of risk in a systemic way and provide comprehensive understanding of risk generation and distribution corresponding to flows of substances in the anthroposphere and the environment. Substance flow analysis (SFA) and HRA method is integrated to produce a systemic risk assessment method, from which substance management schemes can be derived. In this study, the chromium cycle in Taiwan is used as an example to demonstrate the method, by which the associated substance flow in the economy and the risk caused by the substance in the enviromental system is determined. The concentrations of pollutants in the environmental media, the resultant risks and hazard quotients are calculated with the widely-used CalTOX multimedia model. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, excessive applications of agrochemicals pose threats to the environment and human health. In the last decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have been a hot topic in many fields, especially in agriculture, because of their physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, the prevalent methods for fabricating NPs are uneconomical and involve toxic reagents, hindering their extensive applications in the agricultural sector. In contrast, inspired by biological exemplifications from microbes and plants, their extract and biomass can act as a reducing and capping agent to form NPs without any toxic reagents. NPs synthesized through these bioinspired routes are cost-effective, ecofriendly, and high performing. With the development of nanotechnology, biosynthetic NPs (bioNPs) have been proven to be a substitute strategy for agrochemicals and traditional NPs in heavy-metal remediation of soil, promotion of plant growth, and management of plant disease with less toxicity and higher performance. Therefore, bioinspired synthesis of NPs will be an inevitable trend for sustainable development in agricultural fields. This critical review will demonstrate the bioinspired synthesis of NPs and discuss the influence of bioNPs on agricultural soil, crop growth, and crop diseases compared to chemical NPs or agrochemicals.","[Xu, Liang; Zhu, Zhiwei; Sun, Da-Wen] South China Univ Technol, Sch Food Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang; Zhu, Zhiwei; Sun, Da-Wen] South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Acad Contemporary Food Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang; Zhu, Zhiwei; Sun, Da-Wen] Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Engn & Technol Res Ctr Guangdong Prov Intelligent, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang; Zhu, Zhiwei; Sun, Da-Wen] Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangdong Prov Engn Lab Intelligent Cold Chain Lo, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Sun, Da-Wen] Natl Univ Ireland, Univ Coll Dublin, Food Refrigerat & Computerized Food Technol FRCFT, Agr & Food Sci Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland",South China University of Technology; South China University of Technology; University College Dublin,"Sun, DW (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Sch Food Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China.;Sun, DW (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Acad Contemporary Food Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Sun, DW (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Engn & Technol Res Ctr Guangdong Prov Intelligent, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Sun, DW (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangdong Prov Engn Lab Intelligent Cold Chain Lo, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;Sun, DW (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Univ Coll Dublin, Food Refrigerat & Computerized Food Technol FRCFT, Agr & Food Sci Ctr, Dublin 4, Ireland.",dawen.sun@ucd.ie,"Sun, Da-Wen/B-1899-2012; Xu, Liang/U-6709-2018; Zhu, Zhiwei/C-7039-2012","zhu, zhiwei/0000-0002-6532-225X; Xu, Liang/0000-0002-7064-3787",Key R&D Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region [2018BCF01001]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0400404]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [D2190450]; Contemporary International Collaborative Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Food Innovative Processing and Intelligent Control [2019A050519001]; Common Technical Innovation Team of Guangdong Province on Preservation and Logistics of Agricultural Products [2020KJ145],Key R&D Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; National Key R&D Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Contemporary International Collaborative Research Centre of Guangdong Province on Food Innovative Processing and Intelligent Control; Common Technical Innovation Team of Guangdong Province on Preservation and Logistics of Agricultural Products,"The authors are grateful to the Key R&D Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (2018BCF01001) for its support.

Most aerospace designs therefore emphasize the reduction of mass in all components, including EMI shielding enclosures. Previous work indicates that high volume fraction silver coated ceramic microballoon filled resins provide excellent EMI shielding at extremely low density, while overcoming many of the problems associated with metallic coatings. Unfortunately, poor mechanical properties make these materials unsuitable for most applications. The incorporation of these fillers into the matrix of a fiberglass/epoxy composite is investigated to address the poor mechanical properties of the unreinforced shield material. The volume fraction required to establish continuous particle networks is driven down by the segregation of filler particles to discreet regions external to the fiber reinforcement. Mechanical properties are seen to be largely unaffected by this approach, while shielding effectiveness in excess of 50 dB is obtained at a filler volume fraction of only 19 percent. Tests indicate that this filler configuration is mechanically superior to a layer of filler material at the mid-plane region. The use of conductive short fiber is also investigated as a way to introduce tailorability for specific EMI design requirements, although no significant changes in mechanical or electrical performance were observed relative to conductive microballoon fillers. A composite materials approach is therefore presented which simultaneously offers excellent mechanical and electrical properties at a fraction of the mass of conventional metallic shielding materials and with none of the durability issues associated with metallic coatings.",,,"Olivero, DA (通讯作者)，COLORADO STATE UNIV,COMPOSITE MAT MANUFACTURE & STRUCT LAB,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,,,,,,,11,8,8,0,4,SAMPE PUBLISHERS,COVINA,"1161 PARKVIEW DRIVE, COVINA, CA 91722",0091-1062,,,SAMPE J,Sampe J.,JAN-FEB,1997,33,1,,,,,51,57,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,WA621,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:A1997WA62100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional cancer therapies including chemotherapy are flawed, with off-target and on-target toxicities on the normal cells, requiring newer strategies to improve cell selective targeting. The application of nanomaterial has been extensively studied and explored as chemical biology tools in cancer theranostics. It shows greater applications toward stability, biocompatibility, and increased cell permeability, resulting in precise targeting, and mitigating the shortcomings of traditional cancer therapies. The nanoplatform offers an exciting opportunity to gain targeting strategies and multifunctionality. The advent of nanotechnology, in particular the development of smart nanomaterials, has transformed cancer diagnosis and treatment. The large surface area of nanoparticles is enough to encapsulate many molecules and the ability to functionalize with various biosubstrates such as DNA, RNA, aptamers, and antibodies, which helps in theranostic action. Comparatively, biologically derived nanomaterials perceive advantages over the nanomaterials produced by conventional methods in terms of economy, ease of production, and reduced toxicity. The present review summarizes various techniques in cancer theranostics and emphasizes the applications of smart nanomaterials (such as organic nanoparticles (NPs), inorganic NPs, and carbon-based NPs). We also critically discussed the advantages and challenges impeding their translation in cancer treatment and diagnostic applications. This review concludes that the use of smart nanomaterials could significantly improve cancer theranostics and will facilitate new dimensions for tumor detection and therapy.","[Singh, Virendra Vikram] DRDO, Def Res & Dev Estab, Gwalior 474002, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Solanki, Manoj Kumar] Univ Silesiaia Katowice, Inst Biol Biotechnol & Environm Protect, Fac Nat Sci, Plant Cytogenet & Mol Biol Grp, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland; [Kumar, Anil] Cent Univ Jharkhand, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Life Sci, Kanke 835222, Ranchi, India; [Ruokolainen, Janne; Kesari, Kavindra Kumar] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Kashyap, Brijendra Kumar] Bundelkhand Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Biotechnol Engn, Jhansi 284128, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kesari, Kavindra Kumar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland",Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Defence Research & Development Establishment (DRDE); Central University of Jharkhand; Aalto University; Bundelkhand University; University of Helsinki,"Kesari, KK (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Espoo 02150, Finland.;Kashyap, BK (通讯作者)，Bundelkhand Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Biotechnol Engn, Jhansi 284128, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Kesari, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki 00100, Finland.",brijendrakashyap@yahoo.com; kavindra.kesari@aalto.fi,"SINGH, VIRENDRA/M-4769-2014; Ruokolainen, Janne/F-6369-2010; Kesari, Kavindra/F-9541-2010; Kashyap, Brijendra/AAV-3914-2021; Kumar, Anil/AAP-1453-2020","Kesari, Kavindra/0000-0003-3622-9555; Kumar, Anil/0000-0003-2123-1994; singh, virendra vikram/0000-0003-0183-5213",,,,,366,107,108,27,111,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2470-1343,,,ACS OMEGA,ACS Omega,APR 10,2023,8,16,,,,,14290,14320,,10.1021/acsomega.2c07840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c07840,,APR 2023,31,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,M8LV1,37125102,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000970863800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Interestingly, almost all currently available sources report on composites in which graphene is a high value-added filler or matrix, and only the other phase originates from wastes. Flexibility of process parameters of pyrolysis methods enables the synthesis of biomass-derived graphene composites for virtually any kind of industrial applications. Biomass often acts both as carbon and SiO2 source, while only a few percentages of graphene material induce significant changes in their physicochemical properties. Utilization of wastes for energetic composites increases abruptly due to their outstanding price-to-value ratio and reusability.

Water remediation using persulfate based advanced oxidation process is one of the emerging techniques. In this study, we have developed iron oxide-manganese oxide core-shell nanoparticles doped with transition metal ions for the efficient degradation of bromophenol blue dye, for the first time. Here, the transition metal ion doped MnOx shell enables efficient persulfate activation while the magnetic core facilitate in the effective recovery of used particles. The synthesized particles were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. The presence of dopants is found to significantly change the ratio of Mn3+ to Mn4+, reactivity and mobility of lattice oxygen in doped samples. Silver ion doped MnOx showed the highest dye degradation efficiency of similar to 91% with 1.8 wt% nanoparticles, due to the enhanced reactivity and mobility of lattice oxygen activity of the core-shell nanoparticle in presence of Ag ions in persulfate activation. From the experimental results, the mechanism of activation of persulfate by nanoparticles is elucidated.

However, other nanomaterials can also be incorporated into packaging. Metal oxide nanoparticles have been added to petroleum-based and biopolymers to produce nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical and barrier properties, and their antimicrobial effects have also been reported. However, migration of nano particles from packaging is of concern because of their potential toxicity in the human body and the environment. Scope and approach: This review focuses on the application of metal oxide-based nanoparticles for producing nanocomposites. Advantages of incorporating metal oxide-based nanoparticles into polymers are presented, and migration of these nanomaterials from packaging into foods is discussed. Furthermore, an overview of the regulations for nanomaterials in packaging is presented. Key findings and conclusions: Addition of metal oxide nanoparticles into polymers allows for the production of nanocomposites with increased mechanical strength and water and oxygen barrier properties, and can also confer other benefits including antimicrobial activity and light-blocking properties. Migration studies have demonstrated that only a negligible amount of nanomaterial migrates from packaging into food simulants or foods, suggesting that consumer exposure to these nanomaterials and its associated health risks would be low.

The management of pathogens is critical in the field of agriculture. Many species of pathogenic fungi infect a broad range of hosts including cash crops and agricultural crops. Coffee is one of the most important commercial crop in the economy of many countries in the world. Coffea arabica is infected by several fungal species and results in decrease in the quality and quantity of coffee berries. Infection of fungi in plants not only kills the plants and fruit yield but also affect human being through toxin intoxication. Chemical fungicides are the primary choice for the control of plant pathogenic fungi. However, these chemicals pollute the environment, disturb the normal flora, fauna and aquatic environment. The intake of fungicides through inhalation or ingestion results in serious health consequences including immunological, endocrinal, neurological, gynaecological, and carcinogenic effects. Hence, it is a challenge to find a novel alternative green solution to control both pathogenic fungi and to detoxify the fungal toxins. Green nanotechnology can be adopted to develop eco-friendly nanoformulation to control fungal pathogens. In this study, fungal pathogens were isolated from infected coffee plants and identified through sequencing. The novelty of the study stands on uniqueness of Polyherbal nanoformulation which was synthesized by using Triphala. Antifungal studies were carried out by using a developed Polyherbal nanoformulation. From the results, fungal pathogens were identified as Cladorrhinum flexuosum, Rigidoporus vinctus, Mucor circinelloides, Mucor lusitanicus, and Nigrospora oryzae. On treating these fungal pathogens with PHNF, the radial growth of fungal strains was effectively controlled even at lower concentration of 3.125 mu g/ml. The specific contribution of PHNF is 'synergism' which plays a significant role in controlling the growth of tested fungal pathogens. On further exploration of PHNF in field conditions will help to optimize the dosage for the commercial development of nano based fungicide for the benefit of farmers as well as a solution to global problem. In addition, these PHNF can be formulated to nanosprays and nanomaterials to control the fungal growth during post-harvest condition.","[Ranjani, S.; Hemalatha, S.] BS Abdur Rahman Crescent Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Chennai 600048, Tamil Nadu, India",B.

This article presents an assessment of environmental and resource issues of agro-Food Processing Craft Villages (FPCVs) in RRD using a refined approach to material flow analysis focusing on consistent quantification of uncertainty with particular attention to secondary and empirical data that are often faced in material flow analyses in transition economies. Material flows of agro-Food Processing including eight types of production were examined and linked to activities of private Households, Rice Cultivation, and Pig Farming in a model called Red River Delta. Materials investigated were Goods (i.e., total materials), organic carbon (org.C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). The findings reveal material cycles are almost entirely open, that is, the materials used in FPCVs do not recycle within the region. From similar to 10.5 million tons/year of imported Goods used for agro-Food Processing, final products and utilized materials account for minor fractions (similar to 5%, by weight). Conversely, the majority (88%) is directly discharged. Materials accumulated as stocks represent 1% of Goods (100,000 tons/year), 21% of org.C (similar to 34,000 tons/year), 42% of N (similar to 1,300 tons/year), and 57% of P (similar to 300 tons/year), whose substance concentrations vastly exceed natural resilience capacities. Although agro-Food Processing accounts for negligible material shares in Red River Delta, FPCVs pollution is severe at local levels due to the location of home-based production. Several options for closing material loops at various system scales are recommended for environmental and resource management of FPCVs. The material flow analysis results provide a database that may be used as a decision support tool for production establishments in craft villages and relevant authorities in setting priorities on environmental planning and resource management.

This critical review presents the principal methodologies for performing micro- and nanoencapsulation, classifies them (top-down and/or bottom-up), and discusses the differences and advantages among them; the principal types of encapsulation systems; the natural plant sources, including agro-industrial by-products, of bioactive compounds with interest for the food industry to be encapsulated; the bioavailability of encapsulates; and the main techniques used to analyse micro- and nanocapsules. Research work on the use of encapsulated bioactive compounds, such as lycopene, hydroxytyrosol, and resveratrol, from agro-industrial by-products must be further reinforced, and it plays an important role, as it presents a high potential for the use of their antioxidant and/or antimicrobial activities in food applications and, therefore, in the food industry. The incorporation of these bioactive compounds in food is a challenge and must be evaluated, not only for their nutritional aspect, but also for the chemical safety of the ingredients. The potential use of these products is an available economical alternative towards a circular economy and, as a consequence, sustainability.","[Martins, Valter F.

Unlike traditional approaches, which often rely on copper catalysts and face issues such as unwanted byproducts and metal contamination, this method employs a novel visible-light-active heterogeneous photocatalyst comprised of nanostructured Ag and graphitic carbon nitride (gCN). This Ag-gCN nano catalyst exhibits improved visible-light absorption properties due to a reduced band gap (similar to 2.3 eV) facilitated by the introduction of Ag nanoparticles. Unlike most copper-based catalysts, which are not inherently light-active or rely on UV sources, Ag-gCN absorbs across the visible spectrum (400-800 nm), enabling higher energy efficiency and aligning with sustainable, green chemistry principles. This Ag-gCN nano catalyst was synthesized by immobilizing silver nanoparticles onto gCN, enabling highly efficient and 100% regioselective production of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles at room temperature. The catalyst operates via a single-electron-transfer (SET) mechanism, distinct from traditional metal acetylide coordination pathways, highlighting the crucial role of light in achieving excellent results. This was experimentally confirmed through quenching experiments using various radical scavengers, including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, a scavenger for OH), and p-benzoquinone (BQ, a scavenger for O2 -). Sustainability assessments validated the greenness of our catalytic route, revealing a 100% atom economy, an environmental factor (E-factor) in the range of 1.01-2.96 indicating low environmental impact, a high eco-scale score of 84 and high reaction mass efficiency (RME) of 82.22 out of 100. Additionally, the catalyst demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining a consistent yield over at least five cycles. This innovative approach represents a significant advancement in green chemistry, offering a sustainable, versatile, and efficient alternative for a broad range of substrates in AAC reactions, having advantages over most of the recently reported protocols involving state-of-the-art copper-free heterogeneous photocatalysts.","[Gogoi, Priyanka; Deka, Hirakjyoti; Deori, Kalyanjyoti; Sarma, Diganta] Dibrugarh Univ, Dept Chem, Dibrugarh 786004, Assam, India; [Das, Babulal] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Cent Instruments Facil, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India",Dibrugarh University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati,"Deori, K; Sarma, D (通讯作者)，Dibrugarh Univ, Dept Chem, Dibrugarh 786004, Assam, India.",kalchemdu@gmail.com; dsarma22@dibru.ac.in,"Sarma, Diganta/M-5770-2014; Deori, Kalyanjyoti/U-6834-2018","Sarma, Diganta/0000-0001-5174-418X; Deori, Kalyanjyoti/0000-0003-0411-8324","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India [02(0399)/21/EMR-II]; CSIR, New Delhi, India [EEQ/2018/000326]; SERB-DST, India; CSIR, New Delhi; DST [SR/PURSE/2022/143(C)]; DST-PURSE Project [SR/FST/CS-I/2020/152]; DST-FIST Project; CSIC Dibrugarh University","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); CSIR, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); SERB-DST, India; CSIR, New Delhi(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); DST-PURSE Project; DST-FIST Project; CSIC Dibrugarh University","D.S. and K.D. are thankful to CSIR, New Delhi, India for the research grant [Grant No. 02(0399)/21/EMR-II].

Geochemistry plays a central role, from the processes that accumulate elements into ore bodies, to developing exploration techniques that are used to find them. Geochemistry is also important for the processes that win the resources and redistribute them with the accompanying risks of environmental contamination and threats for human health. As geochemists, it is useful to take a step back and look at the big picture of resources from a global perspective, to consider their place in history and to contemplate their importance. The future of our civilisation depends on their wise use and geochemistry lies at the centre - for ensuring adequate supplies and for minimising the risk of poisoning ourselves. This Perspective summarises the current and future availability of many natural resources. But the main focus is on the most important metals and on phosphorus. The metals are grouped into the big six (iron, chromium, manganese, aluminium, copper and zinc), with some shorter discussion of precious (gold, silver and platinum group metals) and other metals. These other metals are those needed for steel (niobium, vanadium, nickel, molybdenum), for technology (tantalum, zircon, indium, gallium, germanium), for new technological developments in the renewable energy industry (europium, terbium, neodynium, lithium), and the chemical industry (platinum group metals, cobalt and rare earth elements). The sobering common aspect for all of these resources is, that available data suggests that their production has either peaked already or will peak within the next 50 years. Throughout history, the major part of the economy of the world's nations has been driven directly or indirectly by access to and use of natural resources, and this still remains so. Our main findings are that the world is heading towards a restricted access to the key resources that are used by humanity today and these restrictions will have a profound impact on the world economies and life styles of future generations. The challenge is to accept this knowledge, and to find the necessary solutions and adaptions for the future while we still have time and possibility to so. History will judge how well we responded to current resource challenges.","[Sverdrup, Harald U.] Univ Iceland, Ind Engn, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Sverdrup, Harald U.] Lund Univ, Chem Engn, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Ragnarsdottir, K.

Therefore, the present research is focused on the development of multifunctional textiles with simple process. Herein, a highly efficient multifunctional linen fabric finishing agent was developed with nano-ZnO, dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate, vinyl trimethoxysilane, methyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate as raw materials. The finishing agent imparted linen fabric multiple performance characteristics such as hydrophobic, antibacterial and ultraviolet protection. Infrared spectroscopy analysis, particle size test and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the main characteristics of multifunctional linen fabric finishing agent, including the main groups, particle size distribution and particle morphology. The results showed that the nano-ZnO/fluorosilicone-polyacrylate emulsion finishing agent had been successfully prepared, and the finishing agent had good stability. By means of scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and X-ray diffractometry, it was found that the finishing agent successfully covered the surface of the linen fabric, which increased the thermal decomposition temperature of the linen fabric and reduced the crystallinity of the linen fabric, indicating that improved the heat stability and softness of the fabric. Similarly, the application performance of linen fabric was tested. Compared with the original linen fabric, the finished linen fabric had good ultraviolet protection, antibacterial, hydrophobicity, washing fastness and breaking strength, leading to the improvement of the wear performance of linen fabric. Thus, the multifunctional linen fabric finishing agent has the advantages of simple technology, low cost and promising prospect.","[Sui, Zhihui; Guo, Zhian; Li, Yaping; Zhang, Qi; Zu, Bin; Zhao, Xin] Qiqihar Univ, Sch Light Ind & Text, 42 North Wenhua St, Jianhua Dist 161006, Qiqihar, Peoples R China; [Sui, Zhihui; Guo, Zhian; Li, Yaping] Qiqihar Univ, Engn Res Ctr Flax Proc Technol, Jianhua Dist, Qiqihar, Peoples R China",Qiqihar University; Qiqihar University,"Sui, ZH (通讯作者)，Qiqihar Univ, Sch Light Ind & Text, 42 North Wenhua St, Jianhua Dist 161006, Qiqihar, Peoples R China.",szh2736@163.com,,"Sui, Zhihui/0000-0003-4027-6194",Fundamental Research Business Expenses of Universities in Heilongjiang Province [135509314],Fundamental Research Business Expenses of Universities in Heilongjiang Province,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is financially supported by Fundamental Research Business Expenses of Universities in Heilongjiang Province under grant 135509314.",,49,3,3,3,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0040-5175,1746-7748,,TEXT RES J,Text.

Therefore, research and development of a new generation of antimicrobials to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance has become imperative. Current research and technology developments have promoted the improvement of antimicrobial agents that can selectively interact with a target site (e.g., a gene or a cellular process) or a specific pathogen. Antimicrobial peptides and metal nanoparticles exemplify a novel approach to treat infectious diseases. Nonetheless, combinatorial treatments have been recently considered as an excellent platform to design and develop the next generation of antibacterial agents. The combination of different drugs offers many advantages over their use as individual chemical moieties; these include a reduction in dosage of the individual drugs, fewer side effects compared to the monotherapy, reduced risk for the development of drug resistance, a better combined response compared to the effect of the individual drugs (synergistic effects), wide-spectrum antibacterial action, and the ability to attack simultaneously multiple target sites, in many occasions leading to an increased antibacterial effect. The selection of the appropriate combinatorial treatment is critical for the successful treatment of infections. Therefore, the design of combinatorial treatments provides a pathway to develop antimicrobial therapeutics with broad-spectrum antibacterial action, bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic mechanisms of action, and better efficacy against multidrug-resistant bacteria.","[Leon-Buitimea, Angel; Garza-Cardenas, Cesar R.; Garza-Cervantes, Javier A.; Lerma-Escalera, Jordy A.; Morones-Ramirez, Jose R.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Leon-Buitimea, Angel; Garza-Cardenas, Cesar R.; Garza-Cervantes, Javier A.; Lerma-Escalera, Jordy A.; Morones-Ramirez, Jose R.] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Invest Biotecnol & Nanotecnol, Parque Invest & Innovac Tecnol, Apodaca, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon,"Morones-Ramírez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, San Nicolas De Los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.;Morones-Ramírez, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Quim, Ctr Invest Biotecnol & Nanotecnol, Parque Invest & Innovac Tecnol, Apodaca, Mexico.",jose.moronesmr@uanl.edu.mx,"LEÓN-BUITIMEA, ANGEL/X-4542-2019","Garza-Cervantes, Javier A./0000-0002-0542-5417; Leon Buitimea, Angel/0000-0002-5686-4639; Garza Cardenas, Cesar Rodolfo/0000-0003-1178-4317; Morones-Ramirez, Jose Ruben/0000-0001-7009-686X; Lerma-Escalera, Jordy Alexis/0000-0002-9881-2490",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; CONACyT Grants for Basic Science [221332]; Fronteras de la Ciencia grant [1502]; Infraestructura Grant [279957]; Beca Nacional de Posgrado from CONACyT,Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; CONACyT Grants for Basic Science; Fronteras de la Ciencia grant; Infraestructura Grant; Beca Nacional de Posgrado from CONACyT,We would like to acknowledge Paicyt 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Science Grant from the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; CONACyT Grants for Basic Science grant 221332; Fronteras de la Ciencia grant 1502; and Infraestructura Grant 279957.

This paper considers how investors can use each approach to differentially influence managers to make more CSR investments. The paper uses game theory with an all-pay contest structure to model how a large institutional investor could reward firms for CSR activities by creating a socially responsible investment fund (reward contest) or punish firms via shareholder activism (punishment contest). We identify conditions under which the punishment contest induces a higher level of CSR activity among firms compared to the reward contest. Managers bearing substantial private costs stemming from the activism is one such condition. Spillover effects are seen as the other managers in the economy engage in CSR to avoid being punished by the investor's activism. This level of engagement is not the case when rewards are used-only those managers with an expectation of being rewarded increase their CSR activity in that scenario. This suggests, for example, that incorporating thresholds or tiers (e.g. gold, silver, and bronze-level winners) can increase the effectiveness of reward contests. Implications for designing both positive and negative CSR inducements are explored. We also identify the ethical dilemmas that relate to such influence attempts.","[Mackey, Tyson B.; Mackey, Alison] Clarkson Univ, Org & Consumer Studies, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; [Christensen, Lisa Jones] Brigham Young Univ, Management, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Lepore, Jason J.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Clarkson University; Brigham Young University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Mackey, A (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, Org & Consumer Studies, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",tmackey@clarkson.edu; amackey@clarkson.edu,"Mackey, Ty/C-4327-2019; Jones Christensen, Lisa/KIA-7324-2024","Mackey, Ty/0000-0001-5481-5473; Jones Christensen, Lisa/0000-0002-5226-8055",,,,,87,17,20,7,96,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Animal coronaviruses remain as one of the intriguing problems, known to cause deadly viral diseases on economically important animal population, and also these infections may spread to other animals and humans. Through isolation of the infected animals from others and providing appropriate treatment using antiviral drugs, it is possible to prevent the virus transmission from animals to other species. In recent times, antiviral drug-resistant strains are being emerged as a deadly virus which are known to cause pandemic. To overcome this, nanoparticles-based formulations are developed as antiviral agent which attacks the animal coronaviruses at multiple sites in the virus replication cycle. Nanovaccines are also being formulated to protect the animals from coronaviruses. Nanoformulations contain particles of one or more dimensions in nano-scale (few nanometers to 1000 nm), which could be inorganic or organic in nature. This review presents the comprehensive outline of the nanotechnology-based therapeutics formulated against animal coronaviruses, which includes the nanoparticles-based antiviral formulations and nanoparticles-based adjuvant vaccines. The mechanism of action of these nanoparticles-based antivirals against animal coronavirus is also discussed using relevant examples. In addition, the scope of repurposing the existing nano-enabled antivirals and vaccines to combat the coronavirus infections in animals is elaborated.","[Krishnan, Saravanan; Thirunavukarasu, Ashokkumar] Dhanvantari Nano Ayushadi Pvt Ltd, Chennai 600017, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jha, Niraj Kumar] Sharda Univ, Sch Engn & Technol SET, Dept Biotechnol, Plot 32-34,Knowledge Pk 3, Greater Noida 201310, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Gahtori, Rekha] Kumaun Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Sir JC Bose Tech Campus, Naini Tal 263136, Uttarakhand, India; [Roy, Ayush Singha] Amity Univ, Amity Sch Biotechnol, Dept Biotechnol, Mumbai Pune Expressway, Mumbai 410206, Maharashtra, India; [Dholpuria, Sunny] JC Bose Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, YMCA, Faridabad 121006, Haryana, India; [Kesari, Kavindra Kumar] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Appl Phys, Espoo, Finland; [Singh, Sachin Kumar] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Phagwara, Punjab, India; [Dua, Kamal] Univ Technol Sydney, Grad Sch Hlth, Discipline Pharm, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Gupta, Piyush Kumar] Sharda Univ, Sch Basic Sci & Res SBSR, Dept Life Sci, Plot 32-34,Knowledge Pk 3, Greater Noida 201310, Uttar Pradesh, India","Sharda University; Kumaun University; J.C.

One of the most attractive waste streams in cities is waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as they contain many valuable metals, mainly in the printed circuit board (PCB), with a high risk of a disruption in their supply. Many of the PCBs contained in small WEEE are separated by destructive operations, as the economic feasibility of their separation using non-destructive operations remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of separating the PCB and the permanent magnets (PMs) contained in hard disk drives (HDD) using non-destructive operations. The economic cost of separating these parts is evaluated by the disassembly sequences, the disassembly schemes, and using the 'ease of Disassembly Metric' (eDiM). In HDD, the economic cost for the non-destructive separation of the PCB is V0.05 while the cost to harvest the PCB as well as the PMs is V0.39. In both cases, such cost is well below the estimated economic value of the gold, silver, and palladium contained in the PCB (V0.85). As a result, the paper concludes that the separation of the PCB and the PMs of HDDs is economically profitable. Measures for promoting the non-destructive separation of the PCBs and the PM of HDDs should be further promoted, as they could help improve the supply of secondary raw materials.

It also facilitates work and improves work outcomes in care systems. Currently, in European Union member states, many older adults seek acceptance to nursing homes too early. Current capacities of available nursing homes are in several member states insufficient to cater to increasing demand from the ageing population. How to prolong living in the community and postpone the reallocation to the nursing home is a major challenge in the European ageing society. According to the Web of Science, in the last 20 years, there has been growing research interest in ambient assisted living. Until now, the field of nursing and the field of social care in many member states are not integrated sufficiently, resulting in increased expenditures for nursing and social care on one hand and lack of services provided for a growing number of older adults with declining functional capabilities on the other hand. This paper aims to review the literature on the ambient assisted living and introduce the multiple decrement model for the measurement of efficiency of developed ambient assisted living technologies that are incorporated into the systems for management and control of long-term care services.

Both precious and special metals are contained in complex components with only small concentrations per unit. After the use-phase, waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE) is an important source of these trace elements. Their recycling requires appropriate processes in order to cope with the hazardous substances contained in WEEE and to recover efficiently the valuable materials. Although state-of-the-art preprocessing facilities are optimized for recovering mass-relevant materials such as iron and copper, trace elements are often lost. The objective of this article is to show how a substance flow analysis (SFA) on a process level can be used for a holistic approach, covering technical improvement at process scale, optimization of product life cycles, and contributing to knowledge on economy-wide material cycles. An SFA in a full-scale preprocessing facility shows that only 11.5 wt.% of the silver and 25.6 wt.% of the gold and of the palladium reach output fractions from which they may potentially be recovered. For copper this percentage is 60. Considering the environmental rucksack of precious metals, an improvement of the recycling chain would significantly contribute to the optimization of the product life cycle impact of EEE and to ensuring the long-term supply of precious metals.","[Chancerel, Perrine; Rotter, Vera Susanne] Berlin Univ Technol, Berlin, Germany; [Meskers, Christina E.

The resulting fiber mats were proposed for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) removal from water. The efficiency of three fibers with different lysine amounts (10, 20, and 30%) was investigated. The incorporation of amino groups in PVA fibers was firstly proved by FTIR, SEM, and elemental analysis, confirming the presence of lysine. Among the three different fibers, PVA-LYS 30% has shown the best removal efficiency, reaching 65%, at pH equal to 5. Adsorption isotherms were studied and showed that the Langmuir model is the best model fitting our experimental results, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 20.1 mg g(-1). Metal-ligand interactions and electrostatic attraction between protonated amino groups of lysine on the fibers and negatively charged, citrate capped, AuNPs are the main proposed mechanisms for AuNP adsorption on the fibers. Sustainability of AuNPs adsorbed on these fibers has been checked through their reuse as catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. The process was completed within 60 min, and their reusability showed more than 99% efficiency after 5 reduction cycles. Our results prove that green PVA-LYS fibers can extract nanoparticles from water, as low cost-effective and eco-friendly adsorbent, and contribute to the promotion of a circular economy approach, through their reuse as catalyst in the reduction of pollutants.","[Ben Khalifa, Eya; Cecone, Claudio; Bracco, Pierangiola; Malandrino, Mery; Paganini, Maria Cristina; Magnacca, Giuliana] Torino Univ, Dept Chem, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Ben Khalifa, Eya; Cecone, Claudio; Bracco, Pierangiola; Malandrino, Mery; Paganini, Maria Cristina; Magnacca, Giuliana] Torino Univ, NIS Interdept Ctr, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; University of Turin,"Cecone, C (通讯作者)，Torino Univ, Dept Chem, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy.;Cecone, C (通讯作者)，Torino Univ, NIS Interdept Ctr, Via P Giuria 7, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",claudio.cecone@unito.it,"Cecone, Claudio/AEF-3177-2022; Bracco, Pierangiola/G-8522-2011","Bracco, Pierangiola/0000-0003-0477-2086; Paganini, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-6248-7243; Cecone, Claudio/0000-0002-2660-9522; eya, ben khalifa/0000-0001-7813-8120",Compagnia di San Paolo; University of Turin,Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo); University of Turin,This work was financially supported by Compagnia di San Paolo and University of Turin (Bando Ex-Post Anno 2018 and Bando Ex-Post Anno 2020).

The advancement of these devices hinges on the development of highly stable and selective CO2 reduction catalysts that can operate in an array of biocompatible conditions. Here, we fabricated a porous silver gas diffusion electrode (GDE) on the carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported hydrophobic membrane for tunable electrochemical syngas production. We then tested its performance under the direct gas delivery mode, different chamber thicknesses, and different microbial-electrolyte compositions. Distinct from traditional flow-by delivery, CO2 was directly flowed through the GDE and electrochemically converted to syngas and delivered into the electrolyte. The optimized reactor with the narrower chamber enabled higher CO faradic efficiencies (FEs) (similar to 92 vs similar to 42%) and larger tunable CO/H-2 ratios (35:65 to 91:9 vs 12:88 to 41:59). The impact of complex microbial growth media on electrocatalysis was also investigated, and it was found that the systems achieved consistent >90% FE for syngas production, but nutrient ingredients such as NH4Cl and yeast extract led to much higher H-2 production due to the significant increase in proton availability from these species. The culmination of these findings helps address key limitations at the microbial-electrode interface that aid in the development of practical artificial photosynthetic technologies toward the sustainable production of green fuels and chemicals.","[Zhu, Xiaobo; Jack, Joshua; Bian, Yanhong; Chen, Xi; Ren, Zhiyong Jason] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zhu, Xiaobo; Jack, Joshua; Bian, Yanhong; Chen, Xi; Ren, Zhiyong Jason] Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Tsesmetzis, Nicolas] Shell Int Explorat & Prod Inc, New Energies Res & Technol, Houston, TX 77082 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; Royal Dutch Shell,"Ren, ZJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Ren, ZJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",zjren@princeton.edu,"Chen, Xi/W-4544-2019; Jack, Joshua/GRN-7872-2022; Zhu, Xiaobo/N-2436-2015; Bian, Yanhong/JKJ-6453-2023; Ren, Zhiyong/A-7401-2019","Tsesmetzis, Nicolas/0000-0001-5246-0568; Ren, Zhiyong/0000-0001-7606-0331; Chen, Xi/0000-0003-2360-2672; Bian, Yanhong/0000-0001-9354-0740; Jack, Joshua/0000-0001-5056-3213","Shell-National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [000034161]; seed innovation grant from the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; Princeton Center for Complex Materials (PCCM), a National Science Foundation (NSF)MRSEC program [DMR-2011750]","Shell-National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL); seed innovation grant from the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; Princeton Center for Complex Materials (PCCM), a National Science Foundation (NSF)MRSEC program","We appreciate the supports from Shell-National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under Subcontract No. 000034161 and a seed innovation grant from the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University.

Unfortunately, this material causes damage to the environment and human health through the large quantities of water required to grow the cotton plant, the toxic substances needed to dye the textile, the process of sandblasting to give denim an old, worn look and the large amounts of waste that result from its vast usage. This research aimed to develop advanced denim materials based on a blend of high-tech fibres, eco-friendly fibres with silver ions (Ag) and cotton fibres. The main purposes of developing these materials were to improve the mechanical potential under the repeated stresses of traction, friction, and tearing and to improve the psychosensory comfort by optimally combining the fabric pattern, the fibrous composition and the component yarn structure. By prolonging the life of these materials so that people can wear them longer, denim textile manufacturers can contribute to the global effort to become more sustainable. The textile structures were designed using the logical design scheme of a woven structure. The preparation of yarns for weaving and the weaving process was performed on equipment from the Experimental Station of the National Research and Development Institute for Textiles and Leather (INCDTP).

Intensive synthesis of NPs/NMs carried out via physico-chemical technologies is deteriorating the environment globally. Therefore, an urgent need to adopt cost-effective and green technologies to synthesize NPs/NMs by recycling of secondary waste resources is highly required. Environmental wastes such as metallurgical slag, electronics (e-waste), and acid mine drainage (AMD) are rich sources of metals to produce NPs. This concept can remediate the environment on the one hand and the other hand, it can provide a future roadmap for economic benefits at industrial scale operations. The waste-derived NPs will reduce the industrial consumption of limited primary resources. In this review article, green emerging technologies involving lignocellulosic waste to synthesize the NPs from the waste streams and the role of potential microorganisms such as microalgae, fungi, yeast, bacteria for the synthesis of NPs have been discussed. A critical insight is also given on use of recycling technologies and the incorporation of NMs in the membrane bioreactors (MBRs) to improve membrane functioning and process performance.

CQDs are ultimately small nanoparticles with an average size below 10 nm, possessing high water solubility, alluring photoluminescence, photostability, excellent biocompatibility, low/none toxicity, environmental friendliness, and high sustainability, etc. In history, there are intermittent threats from viruses to humans, animals and plants worldwide, resulting in enormous crises and impacts on our life, environment, economy and society. Some recent studies have unveiled that certain types of CQDs exhibited high and potent antiviral activities against various viruses such as human coronavirus, arterivirus, norovirus and herpesvirus. Moreover, they have been successfully explored and developed for different virus detections including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This article exclusively overviews and discusses the recent progress of designing, synthesizing, modifying/functionalizing and developing CQDs towards effective virus detection as well as the inhibition and treatment of viral infection. Their mechanisms and applications against various pathogenic viruses are addressed. The latest outcomes for combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) utilizing CQDs are also highlighted. It can be envisaged that CQDs could further benefit the development of virus detectors and antiviral agents with added broad-spectrum activity and cost-effective production.","[Xue, Yuxiang] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Bioengn, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3HL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Liu, Chenchen] Imperial Coll London, Fac Med, Dept Metab Digest & Reprod, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Andrews, Gavin; Ge, Yi] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Pharm, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wang, Jinyan] China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Shenyang 110122, Peoples R China",University of Edinburgh; Imperial College London; Queens University Belfast; China Medical University,"Ge, Y (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Pharm, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland.",y.ge@qub.ac.uk,"Liu, Chenchen/IVU-8495-2023","Andrews, Gavin/0000-0003-4551-0293; Ge, Yi/0000-0002-1037-3834",,,,,231,56,57,13,111,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-5404,,,NANO CONVERG,Nano Converg.,APR 2,2022,9,1,,,,,,,15,10.1186/s40580-022-00307-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40580-022-00307-9,,,31,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,0G8LU,35366117,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000778291800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Liquid-like Nanoparticle Organic Hybrid Materials (NOHMs) are composed of polymers tethered to nanoparticles and are previously explored as CO2 capture materials and electrolyte additives. In this study, two types of aqueous NOHM-based electrolytes are prepared to explore the effect of CO2 binding energy (i.e., chemisorption versus physisorption) on CO2 electroreduction over a silver nanoparticle catalyst for syngas production. Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and Jeffamine M2070 (HPE) are ionically tethered to SiO2 nanoparticles to form the amine-containing NOHM-I-PEI and ether-containing NOHM-I-HPE, respectively. At less negative cathode potentials, PEI and NOHM-I-PEI-based electrolytes produce CO at higher rates than 0.1 molal. KHCO3 due to favorable catalyst-electrolyte interactions. Whereas at more negative potentials, H-2 production is favored because of the carbamate electrochemical inactivity. Conversely, HPE and NOHM-I-HPE-based electrolytes display poor CO2 reduction performance at less negative potentials. At more negative potentials, their performance approached that of 0.1 molal. KHCO3, highlighting how the polymer functional groups of NOHMs can be strategically selected to produce value-added products from CO2 with highly tunable compositions.","[Feric, Tony G.; Lee, Gahyun Annie; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Feric, Tony G.; Hamilton, Sara T.; Lee, Gahyun Annie; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa] Columbia Univ, Lenfest Ctr Sustainable Energy, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hamilton, Sara T.; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ko, Byung Hee; Jiao, Feng] Univ Delaware, Dept Chem Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Verma, Sumit] Shell Int Explorat & Prod Inc, Houston, TX 77082 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; University of Delaware; Royal Dutch Shell,"Park, AHA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Chem Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Park, AHA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Lenfest Ctr Sustainable Energy, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Park, AHA (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ap2622@columbia.edu,"Jiao, Feng/JOV-2445-2023","Hamilton, Sara/0000-0003-1906-8497; Feric, Tony/0000-0001-5608-570X; Lee, Ga Hyun/0000-0003-1013-7011; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa/0000-0002-6482-3589","Shell's Long Range Research and Experimentation (LRRE) Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0019409]; Shell's Long Range Research and Experimentation (LRRE) Program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0019409]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0019409] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","Shell's Long Range Research and Experimentation (LRRE) Program - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Shell's Long Range Research and Experimentation (LRRE) Program; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","This work was funded by Shell's Long Range Research and Experimentation (LRRE) Program.

Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) has emerged as a promising source of raw materials, particularly for metal recycling and the valorisation of plastic fractions. In 2022, approximately 62 million metric tons of e-waste were generated worldwide, with projections indicating a rise to 74 million metric tons by 2030. Despite the significant volume of WEEE, only 17.4% was collected and recycled, which reveals a considerable opportunity for resource recovery. This review highlights the composition of metals in WEEE, which includes valuable precious metals, such as gold, silver, and palladium, alongside base metals, such as copper and aluminium. The review also discusses current methodologies for metal recovery and focuses on mechanical size-reduction techniques and various physical separation methods, including a shaking table, magnetic, electrostatic, and eddy current separation, flotation, and the use of a hydrocyclone. These technologies play a vital role in enhancing recovery efficiencies, thereby contributing to sustainable practices in the recycling industry. Thus, the works evaluated in this paper reveal the possibility of recovering more than 90 wt.% of precious (Ag, Au, Pd, Pt) and main metals (Cu, Sn, Al, Fe, Ni) by a combination of these mechanical size-reduction and physical separation methods.","[Chicardi, Ernesto; Sepulveda-Ferrer, Ranier Enrique; Gallardo, Jose Maria] Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Dept Ingn & Ciencia Mat & Transporte, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Lopez-Paneque, Antonio] Asociac Invest & Cooperac Ind Andalucia AICIA, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Garcia-Orta, Victoria Humildad Gallardo] Atlantic Copper SLU, Francisco Montenegro Ave, Huelva 21001, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Chicardi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Dept Ingn & Ciencia Mat & Transporte, Camino Descubrimientos S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",echicardi@us.es; alpaneque@us.es; vgallard@fmi.com; rsepulveda@us.es; josemar@us.es,"Fuentes, José/ABH-7496-2020; Chicardi, Ernesto/ABH-4274-2020; Sepulveda Ferrer, Ranier Enrique/S-6622-2017","Sepulveda Ferrer, Ranier Enrique/0000-0002-7195-8131; Gallardo Fuentes, Jose Maria/0000-0002-7007-2259",EIT Raw Materials; [21021],EIT Raw Materials;,This research was funded by EIT Raw Materials [project no. 21021].,,79,0,0,17,17,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4701,,METALS-BASEL,Metals,FEB,2025,15,2,,,,,,,140,10.3390/met15020140,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met15020140,,,19,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Y1Z5E,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001430192800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has become a major issue on a global scale that seriously jeopardizes people's health and welfare as well as affects society and overall economy. In view of this, there is an urgent need to detect pollutants in the agroecosystem so that remediation practices can be implemented in time. The evolution of more responsive, affordable and precise technology is needed to create nano-sensors or nanodevices that can be used to monitor agricultural pollution, and the processes involved in pollution control. Major focused ones are those that can detect pollutants at very low concentration levels, as well as point-to-point sensing, in situ, and uninterrupted monitoring devices that offer synchronized data. These sensors are readily available in the market for the detection of organic pollutants, gases, volatile organic molecules, heavy metal ions, hazardous metal ions, etc. but they consume a lot of power and lack sophisticated technologies for improved selectivity and sensitivity. Their precision, sensitivity, response speed and environmental stability under actual operating conditions can all be improved with the aid of nanotechnology.

We measure climate risks in terms of both the change in the northern hemisphere temperature anomaly and its volatility and the change in the global temperature anomaly and its volatility. We study monthly data for eight advanced countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US)). Our sample period runs from 1916 to 2021. We control for cross-market spillovers of stock market returns and volatility as well as other risks including oil-price returns and volatility, geopolitical risks, and the gold-to-silver price ratio as a measure of investor risk aversion. Given this large array of control variables, we apply the Lasso estimator to trace out the incremental predictive value of climate risks for subsequent stock market returns. We find that climate risks do not have systematic predictive value for subsequent stock market returns. We then extend our analysis in two ways. First, we show that climate risks have short-term out-of-sample predictive value for the connectedness of stock market returns. Second, we show that climate risks have predictive power for stock market returns when we study monthly historical UK data for the sample period from 1772 to 2021.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Univ New Haven, Dept Econ & Business Analyt, 300 Boston Post Rd, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, Turkiye; [Balcilar, Mehmet] OSTIM Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06374 Ankara, Turkiye; [Gabauer, David] Software Competence Ctr Hagenberg, Data Anal Syst, A-4232 Hagenberg, Austria; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Pierdzioch, Christian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany",University New Haven; Eastern Mediterranean University; Ostim Technical University; Softwarepark Hagenberg; University of Pretoria; Helmut Schmidt University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; macroeconomics@hsu-hh.de,"Gupta, Rangan/ACM-0361-2022; Gabauer, David/MEO-7469-2025; BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Balcilar, Mehmet/C-8060-2016",", Rangan/0000-0001-5002-3428; Gabauer, David/0000-0003-2465-5741; Balcilar, Mehmet/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,65,6,6,8,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,APR 27,2023,11,9,,,,,,,2077,10.3390/math11092077,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math11092077,,,21,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,G2QM8,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000987665700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper constructs a decomposition system of tobacco taxation: the population aging factor is included in the influencing factors of personal tax, and personal tax revenue is regarded as the product of tax structure, macro tax burden, regional economy, reciprocal aging, and the elderly population. This article conducts an empirical study on the relationship between taxation and economic growth. The estimated coefficients of business tax and corporate income tax are significant at the significance level of 0.1, with a consumption tax and time-variable coefficients reporting a 0.02 level of significance. The T statistic value and the explanatory degree of the variables involved in the model to the explained variables are also very high, reaching more than 95%. We find that increasing the macro tax burden negatively impacts economic growth. Therefore, the study suggests that for fostering the industry's economic growth, the country needs to ensure the optimal macro tax burden of 17.5%, with different types of taxes influencing economic growth. Personal tax reform should pay attention to the phenomenon of aging, adjust the tax structure to increase personal tax income, provide policy support and guarantee for the elderly labor force, and encourage the re-employment of silver-haired people to alleviate the adverse impact of aging on taxation.","[Zhao, Shuang] Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Sch Econ, Tongliao, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities,"Zhao, S (通讯作者)，Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Sch Econ, Tongliao, Peoples R China.",951005234@qq.com,,,,,,,30,7,7,5,17,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Tackling antimicrobial resistance requires swiftly identifying new agents with unique mechanisms. Multicomponent reactions offer a vital method to produce diverse analogs in various heterocyclic compounds, with broad medicinal applications. This study synthesized a range of peptidomimetics using isocyanide-based multicomponent Ugi reactions. These analogs were screened for antimicrobial efficacy against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus IGMS-01), with ampicillin as a reference antibiotic, and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans, using fluconazole as a reference. The compounds showed moderate but significant efficacy across all tests. Docking analysis with microbial proteins revealed notable binding affinities for peptidomimetics 5h (N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-N-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxoethyl)stearamide) and 5i (N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-N-(1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxoethyl)oleamide). Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions between the ligands and proteins. Furthermore, the long alkyl chain analogs demonstrated the ability to form organo/ hydrogels, facilitating the incorporation of silver sulfadiazine for controlled antimicrobial release. This innovative approach enhances drug dispersion within the gel structure, effectively inhibiting microbial growth. These findings highlight the potential of these adaptable materials to advance drug development efforts in the foreseeable future.","[Sebastian, Sharol; Rohila, Yajat; Meenakshi; Ansari, Azaj; Gupta, Manoj K.] Cent Univ Haryana, Sch Basic Sci, Dept Chem, Mahendergarh 123031, Haryana, India; [Prakash, Shaurya; Kumar, Antresh] Cent Univ Haryana, Sch Interdisciplinary & Appl Sci, Dept Biochem, Mahendergarh 123031, Haryana, India; [Sengupta, Sounak; Kumar, Deepak] Shoolini Univ, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Solan 173229, Himachal Prades, India",Central University of Haryana; Central University of Haryana; Shoolini University,"Ansari, A; Gupta, MK (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Haryana, Sch Basic Sci, Dept Chem, Mahendergarh 123031, Haryana, India.",ajaz.alam2@gmail.com; mkgupta@cuh.ac.in,"Kumar, Deepak/AFG-9491-2022; Gupta, Manoj/AAU-5118-2021; Kumar, Antresh/ISB-0241-2023","Sengupta, Sounok/0000-0002-2052-7227; Prakash, Shaurya/0000-0003-4757-5373; Kumar, Deepak/0000-0003-2241-0054","University Grants Commission (UGC) , New Delhi","University Grants Commission (UGC) , New Delhi(University Grants Commission, India)","SS thank University Grants Commission (UGC) , New Delhi for the award of JRF and SRF research fellowships.",,67,3,3,5,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-2860,1872-8014,,J MOL STRUCT,J.

For example, in the Olympic Games, each participant country has two stages-the preparation of athletes and competition of athletes-and at a single game the total numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals (the DMU outputs) are fixed. Such an evaluation scenario is very common in practice, but none of the existing approaches adequately analyze this kind of situation. This paper addresses this scenario and proposes a two-stage DEA approach with fixed-sum final outputs. The approach has two steps: constructing a common efficient frontier and evaluating the DMUs based on that frontier. To illustrate the proposed approach, we apply it to a real dataset for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. Our results show that: (1) countries with high latitudes and a developed economy had much better efficiency; (2) the efficiency of the whole two-stage Olympic process is much more correlated with competition stage efficiency than with preparation stage efficiency; and (3) there are few DMUs whose efficiency in both stages is better than average. Finally, policy suggestions are made to help inefficient nations to win more Olympic medals. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The main obstacle to the development of the hydrogen economy is its low cost-competitiveness. In order to meet energy demand and mitigate environmental damage, it is advisable to replace the existing fossil fuels with technologies that are more environmentally friendly and cost-competitive at the same time. Nowadays, some 97 % of hydrogen production comes from steam reforming of natural gas via energy that is obtained from fossil fuels. The production costs for 1 kg of hydrogen produced in this way, are between 2 and 4 euro, while approximately 10 kg of CO2 is emitted. The production cost of hydrogen produced by electrolysis from water is about 7 euro, 80 % of which is electricity cost. The production of (bio)hydrogen (via photobiological and dark fermentation techniques) from biowaste using renewable energy sources has recently come to the fore. This review discusses use of various types of nanoparticles (organic and inorganic) in (bio)hydrogen production. A diversity of organisms, in pure as well as mixed forms, could perhaps produce (bio)hydrogen using pure (preferably simple form) carbohydrates and biowaste as a feedstock in the existence of various forms of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the (bio)hydrogen production potential (and cost), have indeed been reported to change considerably depending on what type of nanoparticles used as well as their dosage.","[Marousek, Josef] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Technol, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic; [Marousek, Josef] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Agr & Technol, Studentska 1668, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Marousek, Josef] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Tomas Bata University Zlin","Marousek, J (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Technol, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.;Marousek, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Agr & Technol, Studentska 1668, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.;Marousek, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",,"Marousek, Josef/AAF-7996-2021","Marousek, Josef/0000-0001-5175-1961",,,,,98,67,68,4,49,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,NOV 15,2022,328,,,,,,,,125318,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125318,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125318,,JUL 2022,9,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,4C9MC,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000846766700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Urgently shifting toward renewable and eco-friendly materials is crucial for fostering a green circular economy. Herein, we develop a multifunctional bionanocomposite using an algae-derived carbohydrate biopolymer (alginate) and boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) that can be readily employed as a multifunctional dielectric material. The adopted rational design principle includes spatial locking of superhigh loading of BNNS via hydrogel casting followed by layer-by-layer assembly via solvent evaporation, successive cross-link engineering, and hot pressing. We harness the hierarchical assembly of BNNS and the molecular interaction of alginates with BNNS to achieve synergistic material properties with excellent mechanical robustness (tensile strength similar to 135 MPa, Young's modulus similar to 18 GPa), flexibility, thermal conductivity (similar to 4.5 W m-1 K-1), flame retardance, and dielectric properties (dielectric constant similar to 7, dielectric strength similar to 400 V/mu m, and maximum energy density similar to 4.33 J/cm3) that outperform traditional synthetic polymer dielectrics. Finally, we leverage the synergistic material properties of our engineered bionanocomposite to showcase its potential in green electronic applications, for example, supercapacitors and flexible interconnects. The supercapacitor device consisting of aerosol jet-printed single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes on our engineered bionanocomposite demonstrated a volumetric capacitance of similar to 7 F/cm3 and robust rate capability, while the printed silver interconnects maintained conductivity in various deformed states (i.e., bending or flexing).","[Saadi, M.

However, the presence of metal nanoparticles, including nano-oxides, free nanometals, in all fields of human economy and activity causes the volume of nanocompounds emitted to the biosphere to increase regularly. This is the reason for their gradual build-up in individual components of the environment, including soil and bottom sediments. Nanometals, as materials diversified in terms of chemical properties, require availability of analytical procedures which enable acquisition of reliable information on the presence, volume and physicochemical properties of nanometals. Traditional methods of environmental protection, as far as sample collection, processing and the analysis are concerned, must be adapted to the nanometals emitted into the environment. It must be added that, due to the wide range of nanometals, their selective determination constitutes a major challenge. The challenge is further aggravated by shortage of standard analytical procedures as well as reference substances necessary to ensure adequate control levels and the quality of analytical results. At each study level, these difficulties can be overcome by comparing the results of determinations obtained with a variety of analytical methods and techniques (such as XRD, SEM, FT-IR, UV-vis, NanoSight or ICP-MS-TOF). This kind of procedure enables assessment of possibilities for application of these techniques to standard determinations.","[Rabajczyk, Anna] Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Chair Environm Protect & Modelling, PL-25406 Kielce, Poland",Jan Kochanowski University,"Rabajczyk, A (通讯作者)，Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Chair Environm Protect & Modelling, Ul Swietokrzyska 15, PL-25406 Kielce, Poland.",anna.rabajczyk@ujk.edu.pl,"Rabajczyk, Anna/B-9069-2012","Rabajczyk, Anna/0000-0003-4476-8428",,,,,113,6,6,0,35,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

Coffee processing and consumption lead to substantial amounts of residues, mainly coffee silver skin and spent coffee grounds (SCG) as follows: 1 kg of coffee generates around 2 kg of wet SCG. Around 46% of this total SCG generation is landfilled with the subsequent soil, water and air pollution. So, an alternative solution for large SCG volumes currently sent to landfills is necessary. Livestock products are projected to increase up to by 70% by 2050. Many of the ingredients in the diets of EU livestock are sourced from imported raw materials from the Americas: mainly soybeans, etc. This deficit presents already a risk to social, economic and environmental progress in Europe due to the increasing scarcity of global resources. Hence, the inclusion of biowaste in animal feed is necessary to lead to additional benefits for animal feed sector: availability of environmentally friendly ingredient sources and decrease of dependence on foreign sources. This study demonstrates that coffee spent ground stands as a potential alternative ingredient in dairy cattle due to their availability in Europe, their nutritional characteristics and the results of the growing trials with animals: feeding of 5% SCG in the concentrate did not affect milk yields or fat contents and only a negligible decrease in crude protein (by 1.8%). This is because SCG was formulated as a functional ingredient in the concentrate and therefore would not impair animal performance.","[San Martin, D.; Orive, M.; Inarra, B.; Zufia, J.] AZTI, Dept Efficient & Sustainable Proc, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Astondo Bidea,Edificio 609, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain; [Garcia, A.; Goiri, I.; Atxaerandio, R.] NEIKER, Dept Anim Prod, Granja Modelo Arkaute 46, Vitoria 01080, Araba, Spain; [Urkiza, J.] MIBA S COOP, Poligono Ind Galartza, Etxebarria 48277, Bizkaia, Spain",AZTI,"San Martin, D (通讯作者)，AZTI, Dept Efficient & Sustainable Proc, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Astondo Bidea,Edificio 609, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain.",dsanmartin@azti.es,"Atxaerandio, Raquel/AAV-3636-2020; San Martín, David/GXV-2447-2022; Iñarra, Bruno/AAG-6729-2019; Inarra, Bruno/I-1558-2015; GARCIA, ASER/B-5727-2017","San Martin, David/0000-0002-4549-8071; Zufia Verdejo, Jaime/0000-0002-2877-306X; Atxaerandio, Raquel/0000-0002-8906-8516; Inarra, Bruno/0000-0002-1544-0370; GARCIA, ASER/0000-0001-5519-6766; Orive, Mikel/0000-0002-2391-0336",Basque Government; FEDER funds; Euskadi Rural Development Program 2015-2020,Basque Government(Basque Government); FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); Euskadi Rural Development Program 2015-2020,This study was funded by the Basque Government with FEDER funds and under the Euskadi Rural Development Program 2015-2020.,,35,25,25,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-6815,2190-6823,,BIOMASS CONVERS BIOR,Biomass Convers.

Sustainable, eco-friendly nanotechnology may provide a viable alternative to conventional separation practices, such as solvent extraction, mitigating their environmental footprints. Here, we nanoengineer cellulose pulp to yield cationic hairy cellulose nanocrystals (CHCNC), bearing a high density of quaternary ammonium groups (similar to 2 mmol g(-1)), to selectively remove the PM from Au-Ag-Pd ion mixtures and the complex leachates of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB). Au is recovered via the CHCNC-enabled electrostatic attraction and reduction reaction within seconds at a recovery capacity (q(e)) of up to similar to 772 mg g(-1). Immobilizing CHCNC on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) via a mussel-inspired nanocellulose coating (MINC) yields mussel-inspired cationic nanocellulose-coated MCC (MINC+), which recovers Pd via electrostatic interactions within hours at q(e) up to similar to 559 mg g(-1), and Ag is stoichiometrically recovered using chloride ions. Furthermore, a multi-step batch process is developed to selectively recover Ag, Au, and Pd from the WPCB leachates. CHCNC-enabled sorbents may pave the way for developing advanced bio-based, sustainable materials for selective elemental recovery at industrial scales, promoting circular economy.","[Koshani, Roya; Yeh, Shang-Lin; Pitcher, Mica L.; Franz, Lucas Lawrence; Davis, Mitchell Robert; Park, Min Ju; Qassabi, Said Khalifa Ahmed Al; Pisupati, Sarma, V; Sheikhi, Amir] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Pitcher, Mica L.; Sheikhi, Amir] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Alves, Joelson Patricio Manuel; Shekarian, Younes; Subasinghe, Hevapathiranage Chandima Sudantha; Pisupati, Sarma, V; Rezaee, Mohammad] Penn State Univ, EMS Energy Inst, Ctr Crit Minerals, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sheikhi, Amir] Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sheikhi, Amir] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Penn State Behrend,"Sheikhi, A (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sheikhi@psu.edu,"Pisupati, Sarma/A-9861-2009; Sheikhi, Amir/AAR-9310-2021; Koshani, Roya/IYS-7987-2023",,U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under the Advanced Manufacturing Office [DE-EE0007898]; Dorothy Foehr Huck and J.

This study analyzes the characterization of 655 established pilot zones of ecological civilization construction and 'clear waters and green mountains are as valuable as mountains of gold and silver' innovative practices from 2017 to 2022. The spatial distribution of ecological civilization areas in China follows a pattern where more regions are in the southeast than in the northwest (Hu Line). The focus of China's comprehensive ecological civilization construction has been towards the southwest in the first year and has subsequently shifted towards the northwest. The overall Gini coefficient decreased from 0.494 to 0.299, and regional ecological civilization disparities gradually narrowed. Currently, regional construction disparities between the eastern and western regions are a major obstacle to balanced development; therefore, promoting coordinated regional development is necessary. Various factors affecting the pattern of ecological civilization construction, including natural resources, economic development, social progress, policies, and culture, were identified. The availability of natural resources and economic development cause regional differences in construction levels. This research will help promote the coordinated development of Chinese ecological civilization, while the development experiences of different regions can also provide guidance for sustainable development in developing countries.","[Li, Xiaohan; Qin, Weishan; Qi, Fengxun; Zhang, Shuo] Ludong Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China; [Qin, Weishan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Ludong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Qin, WS (通讯作者)，Ludong Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China.",qinws@ldu.edu.cn,"Li, Xiaohan/MEQ-2866-2025","li, xiaohan/0009-0005-1246-793X",National Social Science Foundation of China [19CGL070]; Shandong Higher Education Youth Innovation Science and Technology Support Program [2021RW042]; Shandong Natural Science Foundation General Project [ZR2023MD126]; Special Fund of Taishan Scholar Project [tsqn202306240],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Shandong Higher Education Youth Innovation Science and Technology Support Program; Shandong Natural Science Foundation General Project; Special Fund of Taishan Scholar Project,This study was supported by the grant from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant Number:19CGL070) and Shandong Higher Education 'Youth Innovation Science and Technology Support Program'(Grant Number:2021RW042) and Shandong Natural Science Foundation General Project (Grant Number:ZR2023MD126) and Special Fund of Taishan Scholar Project (Grant Number:tsqn202306240).,,35,3,3,9,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Nanotechnology is a novel strategy to boost production from agriculture along with superior efficiency, ecological security, biological safety, and monetary security. Modern farming processes increasingly rely on environmentally sustainable techniques, providing substitutes for conventional fertilizers and pesticides. The drawbacks inherent in traditional agriculture can be addressed with the implementation of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology can uplift the global economy, so it becomes essential to explore the application of nanoparticles in agriculture. In-depth descriptions of the microbial synthesis of nanoparticles, the site and mode of action of nanoparticles in living cells and plants, the synthesis of nano-fertilizers and their effects on nutrient enhancement, the alleviation of abiotic stresses and plant diseases, and the interplay of nanoparticles with the metabolic processes of both plants and microbes are featured in this review. The antimicrobial activity, ROS-induced toxicity to cells, genetic damage, and growth promotion of plants are among the most often described mechanisms of operation of nanoparticles. The size, shape, and dosage of nanoparticles determine their ability to respond. Nevertheless, the mode of action of nano-enabled agri-chemicals has not been fully elucidated. The information provided in our review paper serves as an essential viewpoint when assessing the constraints and potential applications of employing nanomaterials in place of traditional fertilizers.","[Goyal, Vinod] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Physiol, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Rani, Dolly] CCS Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Microbiol, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India; [Mehrotra, Shweta] Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bio & Nano Technol, Hisar 125001, Haryana, India; [Deng, Chaoyi; Wang, Yi] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, Dept Analyt Chem, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",CCS Haryana Agricultural University; CCS Haryana Agricultural University; Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology; Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station,"Mehrotra, S (通讯作者)，Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bio & Nano Technol, Hisar 125001, Haryana, India.",shwetamehrotragoyal@gmail.com; chaoyi.deng@ct.gov; yi.wang@ct.gov,"Wang, Yi/AAR-9883-2021","Wang, Yi/0000-0002-2891-0386; Goyal, Vinod/0000-0002-7325-1914","V.G. gratefully acknowledges the World Bank-funded NAHEP-Institutional Development Project.

Additionally, field-effect transistors (FET) engross huge demand in biosensing applications owing to high amplification factors and work like transducers. Herein, fabrication, and the applicability of an eco-friendly, flexible, nanocomposite-decorated cellulose-based paper FET (PFET) chip, are demonstrated. Having cellulose as a dielectric as well as an active channel layer for depositing nanocomposite materials, and electrodes made of silver (Ag) ink, the as-fabricated PFET brings the concept of green electronics. The device exhibited good electrical and electronic behaviour having high electron and hole mobility (mu e and mu h) 3641 cm2V-1S-1 and 2436 cm2V-1S-1 in the absence and 8823 cm2V-1S-1 and 9116 cm2V-1S-1 respectively in the presence of glucose. Moreover, when tested for non-enzymatic glucose sensing under physiological pH conditions, a linear range from 0.1 mM to 5 mM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 3 mu M was observed. Finally, with satisfactory results, we proved the practical applicability of low-voltage PFET biosensors by measuring the glucose content in commercially available energy drinks and artificial urine samples. Hence, we developed a high-performance PFET chip utilising the circular economy concept with an optimised device structure and sensing techniques. We envisage that the device could enable real-time monitoring of glucose levels in commercially available drinks and diabetic urine samples.","[Bushra, Kodiaka Ayshathil; Prasad, Kariate Sudhakara] Yenepoya Univ, Yenepoya Res Ctr, Nano Div, Nanomat Res Lab NMRL, Mangalore 575018, India; [Prasad, Kariate Sudhakara] Yenepoya, Ctr Nutr Studies, Mangalore 575018, India",Yenepoya (Deemed to be University); Yenepoya (Deemed to be University),"Prasad, KS (通讯作者)，Yenepoya, Yenepoya Res Ctr, Nano Div, Nanomat Res Lab NMRL, Mangalore 575017, India.;Prasad, KS (通讯作者)，Yenepoya, Ctr Nutr Studies, Mangalore 575017, India.",ksprasadnair@yenepoya.edu.in,"Prasad, K Sudhakara/N-2072-2019","Kurultak, Ilhan/0000-0001-5607-1375; Kariate, Sudhakara Prasad/0000-0002-3739-8011",,,,,65,5,5,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0026-265X,1095-9149,,MICROCHEM J,Microchem J.,AUG,2023,191,,,,,,,,108755,10.1016/j.microc.2023.108755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2023.108755,,APR 2023,7,"Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,M8EL7,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001032491700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With regard to atom economy and the environmental demands, an ultimate goal of these reactions is to employ molecular hydrogen (H-2) or molecular oxygen (O-2). High-performance heterogeneous catalysts with high activity, selectivity, recoverability, and reusability are ideal for the development of green sustainable processes using H-2 or O-2. Moreover, the heterogeneous catalyst systems are the promising approach to solve the disadvantage of homogeneous ones, such as short lifetimes (low stability), risk of contaminating products with metals (low recoverability), tedious workups for reuse (low reusability), and so on. For the design of highperformance heterogeneous catalysts under liquid-phase redox reactions, metal nanoparticles (NPs) is the most promising strategy because of their unusual properties compared to bulk metal. This review provides an overview of metal NP heterogeneous catalysts developed for redox reactions using H-2 or O-2. The stateof-the-art metal NP catalysts show higher activity and selectivity for the chemoselective hydrogenations of carbonyl, nitro, and alkynyl compounds while retaining C=C bonds, and the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and the Wacker type oxidation of alkenes, which overcome the limitations of the conventional catalyst systems. This improved catalytic performance is due to significant advances in the precise fabrication of nanoscale metals, which has made it possible to explore novel catalysis and design metal active centers.","[Jitsukawa, Koichiro; Mitsudome, Takato] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Dept Mat Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan",The University of Osaka,"Jitsukawa, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Dept Mat Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan.",jitkk@cheng.es.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,96,0,0,0,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1436-6002,1616-8534,978-3-030-56630-2; 978-3-030-56629-6,TOP ORGANOMETAL CHEM,Top.

Here, we introduce ultra-lightweight thiourea-chitosan (CSTU) aerogels engineered by combining successive freeze-thawing cycles with covalent formaldehyde-mediated cross-linking and lyophi-lization. All aerogels exhibited outstanding low densities (0.0021-0.0103 g/cm3) and remarkable high specific surface areas (416.64-447.26 m2/g), outperforming the common polysaccharide-based aerogels. Benefitting from their superior structural features (honeycomb interconnected pores and high porosity), CSTU aerogels demonstrate fast sorption rates and excellent performance in sorption of heavy metal ions from highly -concentrated single or binary-component mixtures (1.11 mmol Ag (I)/g and 0.48 mmol Pb(II)/g). A remark-able recycling stability was observed after five sorption-desorption-regeneration cycles when the removal effi-ciency was up to 80 %. These results support the high potential of CSTU aerogels in the treatment of metal -containing wastewater. Moreover, the Ag(I)-loaded CSTU aerogels exhibited excellent antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains, the killing rate being around 100 %. This data points towards the potential application of developed aerogels in circular economy, by employing the spent Ag (I)-loaded aerogels in the biological decontamination of waters.","[Ghiorghita, Claudiu-Augustin; Lazar, Maria Marinela; Platon, Ioana-Victoria; Doroftei, Florica; Dinu, Maria Valentina] Petru Poni Inst Macromol Chem, Dept Funct Polymers, Grigore Gh Voda Alley 41A, Iasi 700487, Romania; [Humelnicu, Doina] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Chem, Carol I Blvd 11, Iasi 700506, Romania",Romanian Academy; Petru Poni Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Ghiorghita, CA; Dinu, MV (通讯作者)，Petru Poni Inst Macromol Chem, Dept Funct Polymers, Grigore Gh Voda Alley 41A, Iasi 700487, Romania.",claudiu.ghiorghita@icmpp.ro; vdinu@icmpp.ro,"Dinu, Maria/A-9414-2015; Lazar, Maria/S-3205-2016; Ghiorghita, Claudiu-Augustin/N-3458-2013; Humelnicu, Doina/A-3218-2014; Doroftei, Florica/AAR-8690-2021","Doroftei, Florica/0000-0002-1867-1668","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2021-0771, TE3/2022]","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2021-0771 (TE3/2022) .

With the number of these devices operating worldwide expected to reach 18bn by 2025 their low recycling rate leads to large tonnages of End-of-Life Mobile Phones (EoL-MPs) and de facto a challenging waste stream. The rapid replacement of mobile phones to meet consumer demand further compounds the challenges due to increased demand for raw materials, increased energy, and water consumption, and, where uncontrolled and poor disposal at end-of-life occurs, significant impacts on health and the environment.EoL-MPs comprise a complex and heterogeneous combination of materials that include strategically and economically important high technology metals, many of which are classified as critical by the EU. A detailed characterisation of key components (PCBs, casings, screens, cameras, and speakers) of multigenerational (feature phones, multimedia phones, and smartphones) EoL-MPs is studied to determine the potential for recovery of both metal and non-metallic fractions and the economic drivers for recovery of the metal value. On average, the major mass fraction distributed in a mobile phone is: plastics (40%), metals (35%) and ceramics (25%). The results show that 1 tonne of EoL-MPs can contain up to 53 Kg copper, 141 g gold, 270 g silver, 10 g platinum, 18 g palladium and 3.3 Kg rare earth elements, among other valuable metals, with many of these elements found to be at least twice, and in some cases, up to 600 times more concentrated than in their natural ores. The calculated economic value of the EoL-MPs components is in the order: cameras (86,860 US$/ton), printed circuit boards (55,459 US$/ton), speakers (21,853 US$/ton) and screens (3,779 US$/ton). Based on the predicted 5 billion EoL-MPs discarded by the end of 2022, this waste stream has a potential economic value of US $ 9.25 billion. Use of EoL-MPs as a secondary resource-rich stream of these critical materials therefore offers a route to close the materials loop, helps to mitigate the threat to natural resources and the environmental and human health impacts arising from mining operations, relieves supply demands and contributes to the economy.","[Gomez, Moises; Grimes, Sue; Qian, Yuting; Feng, Yexin; Fowler, Geoff] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Grimes, S (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.grimes@imperial.ac.uk,"Qian, Yuting/ACR-3125-2022; Gómez Soto, Moisés/KPA-7619-2024","Feng, Yexin/0009-0005-8410-1873; Gomez Soto, Moises/0000-0003-4553-1641; Grimes, Susan/0000-0003-3513-1062",CONICYT Becas Chile Doctoral Fellowship program [72180123],CONICYT Becas Chile Doctoral Fellowship program,We wish to acknolwedge the support of a research scholarship (to MG) from the CONICYT Becas Chile Doctoral Fellowship program; Grant No. 72180123.,,40,18,19,9,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

High-value waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) are an essential component of e-waste. However, WPCBs are considered hazardous to the ecosystem due to the presence of heavy metals and brominated organic polymers. Therefore, achieving the recycling of metals in WPCBs is not only a strategic requirement for building a green ecological civilization but also an essential guarantee for achieving a safe supply of mineral resources. This review systematically analyzes the hydrometallurgical technology of metals in WPCBs in recent years. Firstly, the different unit operations of pretreatment in the hydrometallurgical process, which contain disassembly, crushing, and pre-enrichment, were analyzed. Secondly, environmentally friendly hydrometallurgical leaching systems and high-value product regeneration technologies used in recent years to recover metals from WPCBs were evaluated. The leaching techniques, including cyanidation, halide, thiourea, and thiosulfate for precious metals, and inorganic acid, organic acid, and other leaching methods for base metals such as copper and nickel in WPCBs, were outlined, and the leaching performance and greenness of each leaching system were summarized and analyzed. Eventually, based on the advantages of each leaching system and the differences in chemical properties of metals in WPCBs, an integrated and multi-gradient green process for the recovery of WPCBs was proposed, which provides a sustainable pathway for the recovery of metals in WPCBs. This paper provides a reference for realizing the gradient hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from WPCBs to promote the recycling metal resources.","[Li, Xi-guang; Gao, Qiang; Jiang, Si-qi; Nie, Chun-chen; Zhu, Xiang-nan; Jiao, Tian-tian] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem & Biol Engn, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Science & Technology,"Zhu, XN; Jiao, TT (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem & Biol Engn, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhuxiangnan1989@163.com; jiaotiantian1988@163.com,"Jiang, Siqi/JHT-4885-2023","Zhu, Xiang-nan/0000-0001-9551-7368",National Natural Science Foundation of China [52204273],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52204273) .

This study aims at shedding first light on how the alignment between dissemination and exploitation activities might contribute to bringing to market innovations developed by public-private partnerships funded by the European Commission (EC). Design/methodology/approach The theoretical development comes from an inductive research design based on the 42-month pan-European H2020 research project NESTORE aimed at developing an integrated portfolio of innovations for the healthy aging of European citizens. Findings This study advances the theory and practice of industrial marketing in health care by conceptualizing an actionable method to align dissemination and exploitation activities within EC-funded projects, facilitating that innovations will go to market. The method is composed of five phases. First, an external analysis to define market opportunities and users'/stakeholders' needs. Second, an internal analysis to identify the most promising exploitable outputs. Third, scenarios crystallization to define the most suitable scenarios (business models) to bring the selected exploitable outputs to market. Fourth, exploitation and dissemination alignment through the identification and involvement of the most relevant stakeholders. Fifth, scenario refinement and business plan. Originality/value This study is relevant because many EC-funded projects still fail to move innovations from labs to market, thus limiting the benefits for the European citizens and the competitiveness of Europe with respect to the USA and China. Although this relevance, past studies overlooked the peculiar context of EC-funded innovation projects, privileging pharmaceutical and biomedical companies.

Sorting and recycling technologies that deal with plastic waste streams exist but face challenges in highly dense urbanized regions such as Singapore because of high space requirements. Multiple small-scale plastic sorting and recycling facilities that are distributed closer to points of waste generation offer the possibility of increasing the recovery of plastic-waste streams in urbanized settings. To holistically quantify the environmental performance of this type of system, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare five different scenarios of distributed and centralized sorting and recycling of plastic bottles and takeaway containers in Singapore. A hybrid simulation model is used to simulate the complex dynamics of waste-processing systems which involves waste generation, collection scheduling, sorting, recycling, and disposal of residual materials. The results of the LCA showed that the life cycle environmental impacts to climate change, water depletion, and terrestrial ecotoxicity of the distributed scenarios were higher than the centralized scenarios by 7-30% depending on the impact category. Although the distributed scenarios had lower total travel distances, their reliance on commercial vans led to their higher environmental impacts than the centralized scenarios. The findings of this study provide motivation for future research in applying hybrid simulation models in LCAs of waste-to-resource exchange networks.

The as -prepared HAN -CNCs can be specifically quenched by Ag + at pH of 5.0 , with a wide detection range ( 5.0 - 300 mu mol/L ) and a low detection limit of 27.5 nmol/L. It was found that Ag + can induce fluorescence static quenching of the HAN - CNCs , owing to the coordination interaction between Ag + and amine groups or carbonyl groups on the surface of HAN - CNCs. More interestingly , the colorimetric detection of Ag + could be additionally realized by visible color conversion ( yellowish - rubricans ) under the daylight lamp and the cyan fluorescence gradually changed to blue purple under the irradiation of an ultraviolet lamp. From this , the HAN - CNCs were employed in the fabrication portable test strip for colorimetry monitoring of Ag + via the green - blue ( G/B ) analysis. In addition , HAN - CNCs exhibit an excellent reversible thermal response in the range of 20 - 85 degree celsius and have potential as a temperature sensor. Furthermore , the HAN - CNCs exhibited a low biotoxicity and an excellent cell permeability when selectively detecting Ag + in living cells by fluorescence microscopy imaging , indicating that the sensing system can be effectively applied to assessing potential risks and health security.","[Li, Lin; Ma, Jing; Xu, Changlin; Chen, Tongyao; Guo, Hengyao; Li, Ziyou; Wu, Wenxin] Taiyuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Humic Acid Engn & Technol Res Ctr Shanxi Prov, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Lab Prot based Funct Mat Shanxi Prov, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China",Taiyuan Normal University,"Li, L (通讯作者)，Taiyuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China.;Li, L (通讯作者)，Humic Acid Engn & Technol Res Ctr Shanxi Prov, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China.;Li, L (通讯作者)，Lab Prot based Funct Mat Shanxi Prov, Jinzhong 030619, Peoples R China.",lilin@tynu.edu.cn,"Ma, Jing/K-3359-2013",,"Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province, China [202203021221216]; Research Fund of Science and Technology Innovation Platform of Shanxi Province, China [410220367]; Teaching Reform Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions of Shanxi Province, China [J20220930]","Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province, China; Research Fund of Science and Technology Innovation Platform of Shanxi Province, China; Teaching Reform Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions of Shanxi Province, China","Supported by the Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province, China (No.202203021221216) , the Research Fund of Science and Technology Innovation Platform of Shanxi Province, China (No.410220367) and the Teaching Reform Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions of Shanxi Province, China (No.J20220930) .",,44,0,0,4,8,HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS,BEIJING,"CHAOYANG DIST, 4, HUIXINDONGJIE, FUSHENG BLDG, BEIJING 100029, PEOPLES R CHINA",0251-0790,,,CHEM J CHINESE U,Chem.

The diesel fuels were US06 (ultra-low sulphur but 24 wt.% aromatics) and Fisher-Tropsch Gas-to-Liquid (FT-GTL) (negligible sulphur and only 0.3 wt.% aromatics). As the hydrocarbon chain length increases, the low-temperature NOx-conversion activity improves, while the reactant selectivity (hydrocarbon SCR versus hydrocarbon oxidation) decreases at higher temperatures. With diesel fuel, the catalyst initially achieves high NOx conversion at low temperature, but the conversion degrades with time due to coking. The rate of degradation is dependent on the nature of the hydrocarbons. Both the long-chain alkanes and the aromatics present in US06 diesel fuel promote the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. However, high NOx conversion can be maintained using a fuel injection strategy that tunes the hydrocarbon/NOx ratio to the inlet temperature, so avoiding coking and improving both selectivity and fuel economy. At low temperatures the hydrocarbon/NOx ratio is kept low, and then increased as a function of temperature to compensate for the loss of hydrocarbon when the direct oxidation by 02 begins to dominate. Optimisation of the fuel injection strategy is different for each type of fuel, but in general the NOx-conversion activity is higher for FT-GTL fuel at comparable hydrocarbon/NOx ratios.

A proper disposal of decommissioned PV panels is crucial for avoiding environmental risks and for recovering value-added materials. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed in order to assess the environmental performance of a new recycling process for crystalline silicon (cSi) PV panels, at the End of Life (EoL). The process was developed in the framework of the ReSiELP (Recovery of Silicon and other materials from the End-of-Life Photovoltaic Panels) project, aiming at recovering valuable resources from EoL PV c-Si modules and making the recovered materials readily available for different supply chains, in line with the principles of Circular Economy. A ?gate to gate? approach was used to investigate two lines of activities: (i) the Recovery line, dedicated to the recovery of secondary raw materials from EoL c-Si PV panels, namely aluminium, copper, glass, silver and silicon, and (ii) the Glass reuse line, for the employment of the recovered glass in prefabricated building components (predalles slabs). The results highlight energy consumption, chemicals and transportation as the main hotspots of the ReSiELP process. For a comprehensive evaluation, the generated loads were compared with the potential environmental benefits gained thanks to the recovery of aluminium, at the largest extent. Overall, the LCA analysis showed that the investigated process is environmentally favorable, also when compared to other EoL PV panels recycling scenarios reported in literature.","[Ansanelli, G.; Fiorentino, G.; Tammaro, M.; Zucaro, A.] ENEA, Dept Sustainabil, Div Resource Efficiency, Res Ctr Port, Naples, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Fiorentino, G (通讯作者)，ENEA, Dept Sustainabil, Div Resource Efficiency, Res Ctr Port, Naples, Italy.",gabriella.florentino@enea.it,"fiorentino, gabriella/F-5499-2019","Fiorentino, Gabriella/0000-0002-2654-4925","European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), European Union, under the Horizon 2020; EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation; Knowledge and Innovation Communities Raw Materials (KIC RM)","European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), European Union, under the Horizon 2020; EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation; Knowledge and Innovation Communities Raw Materials (KIC RM)","This activity has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) , a body of the European Union, under the Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

In this study, equilibrium distributions of Ag, Au, Bi, and Zn between PbO-FeO-Fe2O3-SiO2 silica saturated slag and Pb metal phases were investigated experimentally, using high-temperature equilibration followed by rapid quenching. The measurement of phase compositions was done using microanalytical methods. Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis (EPMA) was applied for those elements which present at relatively high concentrations. The Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to measure very low concentrations of Ag and Au in slag. The starting mixtures of materials were planned using FactSage software and preliminary thermodynamic database to target specific proportions of phases and concentrations of Pb in slag after the achievement of equilibrium. Measured slag/metal distribution coefficients follow the sequence Zn >> Ag > Bi >> Au. Newly obtained results were critically assessed and used to improve the thermodynamic database. Integration between experiments and thermodynamic database development permits cross-analysis of distribution coefficients obtained in the present study with the parallel measurements of distribution in copper-based systems.

It is located in the center-west of Chihuahua, Mexico. Water sampling was performed on rivers and springs, which are the main water supply sources for human consumption. Temperature, total dissolved solids, turbidity and pH parameters were measured in situ. Some mayor (Ca and Mg) and trace elements (Li, Ni, Sb, Se, Cu, and Zn) were quantified by inductively coupled plasma of optical emission. The average of Ca concentration in water was higher in rivers than in springs, whereas Mg contents were only detected in river water. Trace elements measured in waters of river and spring were in decrease trend Ni > Cu >Zn. Li > Se > Sb. The highest trace element concentrations were found in an area highly impacted by activities related to the mining. Most of trace elements concentrations assessed in this work were lower than limits for drinking water marked by Unites States Environmental Protection Agency and Mexican regulations. However, concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Zn obtained in water from rivers are higher than Canadian guidelines for protection of the aquatic life. Although, elemental concentrations determined here are below of the allowed limits, these studies are important because the water in this region have different uses such as human consumption, water supply to agricultural lands, and to industry.","[Chacon Chumacero, Karla Ozuky; Pinedo Alvarez, Carmelo; Renteria Villalobos, Marusia] Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Fac Zootecnia & Ecol, Dept Recursos Nat, Ave Univ & Pascual Orozco S-N, Chihuahua 31110, Chihuahua, Mexico",,"Renteria Villalobos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Fac Zootecnia & Ecol, Dept Recursos Nat, Ave Univ & Pascual Orozco S-N, Chihuahua 31110, Chihuahua, Mexico.",marusia@us.es,"Renteria-Villalobos, Marusia/AAY-7681-2020","Renteria-Villalobos, Marusia/0000-0003-0509-5865",,,,,32,3,3,0,9,CENTRO CIENCIAS ATMOSFERA UNAM,MEXICO CITY,"CIRCUITO EXTERIOR, MEXICO CITY CU 04510, MEXICO",0188-4999,,,REV INT CONTAM AMBIE,Rev.

In particular, nanofluids (NFs) based on core-shell plasmon NPs have become the key to solar thermal utilization. This work proposed an ZrC-Au core-shell NP suitable for direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). The optical properties of ZrC-Au core-shell NP are investigated based on the finite element method (FEM). The physical mechanism of its existence can be explained by the surface plasmon resonance and localized surface plasmon resonance of ZrC-Au core-shell NP. Meanwhile, the effect of core-shell size on the NP optical properties of ZrC-Au core-shell is investigated based on electromagnetic field distribution. In addition, the effects of length (H) and mass flow ((m) over dot) on the temperature rise and efficiency of the collector (eta) are analyzed with DASC 2D simulation. Research shows that ZrC-Au core-shell NPs with t = 5 nm and r(3) = 15 nm can effectively broaden the solar spectral absorption band, increase the absorption peak value, and the photothermal conversion efficiency (f(v) = 20 ppm, h = 15 mm) reaches 96 %, which is 15.89 % higher than Au NP. Meanwhile, the eta of ZrC-Au NPs can be improved by similar to 8.86 % compared with Au NPs under specific parameters (H = 2 cm, L = 20 cm, f(v) = 20 ppm, (m) over dot = 1 g/(s m)). Combined with the preparation possibility and economy of ZrC-Au core-shell NPs, the broad application prospect of this NP in DASC and other photothermal fields was analyzed.","[Yang, Qihang; Zhang, Bin] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Electromech Engn, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Qin, Caiyan] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn & Automat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ning] Shandong First Med Univ & Shandong Acad Med Sci, Med Sci & Technol Innovat Ctr, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haotuo] Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Adv Mfg & Intelligent Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaohu] Shandong Inst Adv Technol, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Qingdao University of Science & Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Harbin University of Science & Technology; Ministry of Education - China,"Zhang, B (通讯作者)，Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Electromech Engn, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.;Wu, XH (通讯作者)，Shandong Inst Adv Technol, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",zb-sh@163.com; xiaohu.wu@iat.cn,"Wu, Xiaohu/ACM-7633-2022; Liu, Haotuo/KIC-6392-2024; ZHANG, BIN/LDG-5717-2024; Chen, Ning/KIA-1515-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [52106099]; Taishan Scholars Program; Stable Funding Support for Universities in Shenzhen [GXWD20231130153633004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholars Program; Stable Funding Support for Universities in Shenzhen,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52106099) , the Taishan Scholars Program, and in part by a grant from the Stable Funding Support for Universities in Shenzhen (GXWD20231130153633004) .",,62,0,0,9,13,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",1290-0729,1778-4166,,INT J THERM SCI,Int.

Currently, transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as commercial Pt/C, IrO2, and RuO2 are still popular catalysts for industrial-level HER and OER processes. However, both the high cost and low atomic utilization of NPs can not satisfy the requirements of atomic economy and green chemistry. Compared with NPs, metallic nanoclusters (NCs), which have higher atom utilization and optimized electronic structure than NPs, show unique activities for water splitting. In this review, the recently reported advanced design strategies for preparing various NCs are discussed in detail. The methods to control the particle size, coordinated environment, and morphology of NCs are also summarized. The electrochemical activity and stability of NCs can be influenced by the synergistic effect between NCs and supporting materials, which is also mentioned. Then, the recently reported state-of-art-catalysts for both HER and OER along with the detailed catalytic mechanism are described to show the advanced design principles. Finally, the future perspectives and some remaining challenges are also presented. In this review, the recent progress of various design and synthesis strategies of transition metal nanoclusters (NCs) on different supporting materials are summarized and discussed. Combined with the reported experimental and theoretical results, the design principles of the structure, morphology, and electronic structure of NCs for boosting the electrochemistry water splitting performance are also introduced.image","[Shao, Xiaodong; Kim, Minseo; Liang, Mengfang; Lee, Hyoyoung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Chem, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Lee, Hyoyoung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Res Inst, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Lee, Hyoyoung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst Quantum Biophys, Suwon 16419, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Chem, Suwon 16419, South Korea.;Lee, H (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Res Inst, Suwon 16419, South Korea.;Lee, H (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Inst Quantum Biophys, Suwon 16419, South Korea.",hyoyoung@skku.edu,"Shao, Xiaodong/MFH-9670-2025","Lee, Hyoyoung/0000-0002-8031-0791",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2022R1 A2 C2093415]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIT) [2022R1 A6 C101 A751]; Korea Basic Science Institute (National Research Facilities and Equipment Center) - Ministry of Education,"National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea Government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Korea Basic Science Institute (National Research Facilities and Equipment Center) - Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT) (NRF-2022R1 A2 C2093415) and partially supported by the Korea Basic Science Institute (National Research Facilities and Equipment Center) grant funded by the Ministry of Education (2022R1 A6 C101 A751).,,133,8,8,11,114,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1867-3880,1867-3899,,CHEMCATCHEM,ChemCatChem,MAR 8,2024,16,5,,,,,,,,10.1002/cctc.202301541,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301541,,JAN 2024,19,"Chemistry, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,KC8B4,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001149984200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adding to recent studies that document the adverse localized impacts of this booming economy, in this article I grapple with the layered geographies of logistics infrastructure that have historically enabled and materially sustained the process of resource extraction, probing the co-production of extraction and logistics. I propose to explore this intersection through the notion of corridor urbanism as proposed by Silver (2021) and chart its underexplored aspects in a context of extended urbanization and resource extraction. Through a mobile ethnography along a segment of the lithium trade's logistical network across the Atacama, I engage with the layered genealogies of three infrastructural elements that have been crucial in the development of this extractive landscape: the upgraded crossborder road and customhouse at Paso de Jama, the recently repaired Huaytiquina railway and the expanded port of Mejillones. Reflecting on these genealogies and their associated dynamics of smoothing, repair and securing, I locate some defining features of corridor urbanism, its extractive dimension, layered temporalities and selective character whereby socioecological wellbeing is unevenly distributed. In conclusion, I argue how a closer engagement with the situated genealogies of corridor urbanism can contribute to a sharper understanding of present and near-future extractive landscapes, especially in the context of a global expansion of resource frontiers and wider technological restructuring.","[Gris, Alberto Valz] Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning DIST, Viale Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, TO, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Gris, AV (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Interuniv Dept Reg & Urban Studies & Planning DIST, Viale Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, TO, Italy.",alberto.valzgris@polito.it,,"VALZ GRIS, ALBERTO/0000-0001-6663-9032","The Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: Innovation Patterns, Urbanization Processes and Global Investments in Urban China  project - Ministero dell 'Universita e della Ricerca within the PRIN program [2017P8C4B2]","The Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: Innovation Patterns, Urbanization Processes and Global Investments in Urban China  project - Ministero dell 'Universita e della Ricerca within the PRIN program","The writing up of this article was supported through the Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: Innovation Patterns, Urbanization Processes and Global Investments in Urban China  project, funded by the Ministero dell 'Universita e della Ricerca within the PRIN program (n. 2017P8C4B2) .

There are several causes behind antibiotic resistance, including over prescription of antibiotics in both humans and livestock. In this scenario, researchers are shifting to new alternatives to fight back this concerning situation. Scope and approach: Nanoparticles have emerged as new tools that can be used to combat deadly bacterial infections directly or indirectly to overcome antibiotic resistance. Although nanoparticles are being used in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a constant concern about their toxicity toward human health because of the involvement of well known toxic chemicals (i.e., sodium/potassium borohydride) making their use very risky for eukaryotic cells. Key findings and conclusions: Multiple nanoparticle-based approaches to counter bacterial infections, providing crucial insight into the design of elements that play critical roles in the creation of antimicrobial nanotherapeutic drugs, are currently underway. In this context, plant-based nanoparticles will be less toxic than many other forms, which constitute promising candidates to avoid widespread damage to the microbiome associated with current practices. This article aims to review the actual knowledge on plant-based nanoparticle products for antibiotic resistance and the possible replacement of antibiotics to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.","[Anand, Uttpal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Carpena, M.; Garcia-Perez, P.; Prieto, Miguel A.; Simal-Gandara, Jesus] Univ Vigo, Nutr & Bromatol Grp, Dept Analyt Chem & Food Sci, Fac Sci, E-32004 Orense, Spain; [Kowalska-Goralska, Monika] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Anim Husb & Breeding, Dept Limnol & Fisheries, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [Sunita, Kumari] Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur Univ, Dept Bot, Gorakhpur 273009, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bontempi, Elza] Univ Brescia, INSTM & Chem Technol Lab, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Via Branze 38, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Dey, Abhijit] Presidency Univ, Dept Life Sci, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, W Bengal, India; [Prockow, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Ul Kozuchowska 7a, PL-51631 Wroclaw, Poland","Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Universidade de Vigo; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University; University of Brescia; Presidency University, Kolkata; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences","Anand, U (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.;Prieto, MA; Simal-Gandara, J (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Nutr & Bromatol Grp, Dept Analyt Chem & Food Sci, Fac Sci, E-32004 Orense, Spain.;Procków, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Ul Kozuchowska 7a, PL-51631 Wroclaw, Poland.",ushuats@gmail.com; mcarpena@uvigo.es; monika.kowalska-goralska@upwr.edu.pl; pasgarcia@uvigo.es; elza.bontempi@unibs.it; abhijit.dbs@presiuniv.ac.in; mprieto@uvigo.es; jsimal@uvigo.es,"Proćków, Jarosław/B-4832-2017; Dey, Abhijit/AAG-2439-2020; sunita, kumari/AAO-5633-2020; García-Pérez, Pascual/ABB-4512-2022; Carpena Rodriguez, Maria/JGD-8937-2023; Bontempi, Elza/F-3216-2010; Kowalska-Goralska, Monika/A-1312-2017; Simal-Gandara, Jesus/A-9533-2009; Prieto, Miguel A./G-4516-2011","Carpena Rodriguez, Maria/0000-0002-4819-7856; Bontempi, Elza/0000-0003-1656-7506; Kowalska-Goralska, Monika/0000-0001-9614-2000; Simal-Gandara, Jesus/0000-0001-9215-9737; Prieto, Miguel A./0000-0002-3513-0054; Garcia-Perez, Pascual/0000-0003-1798-6235","MICINN supporting the Ramon y Cajal grant [RYC-2017-22891]; Xunta de Galicia [EXCELENCIA-ED431F 2020/12, ED481A 2021/313]; Ibero-American Program on Science and Technology [P317RT0003]; Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking (JU) [888003 UP4HEALTH, H2020-BBI-JTI-2019]; European Union; Bio Based Industries Consortium; national research funding parties in Belgium (FWO), France (INRA), Germany (BLE), Italy (MIPAAF), Latvia (IZM), Norway (RCN), Portugal (FCT); FACCE-JPI [696295]; University of Vigo/CISUG","MICINN supporting the Ramon y Cajal grant; Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Ibero-American Program on Science and Technology; Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking (JU); European Union(European Union (EU)); Bio Based Industries Consortium; national research funding parties in Belgium (FWO), France (INRA), Germany (BLE), Italy (MIPAAF), Latvia (IZM), Norway (RCN), Portugal (FCT); FACCE-JPI; University of Vigo/CISUG","The research leading to these results was supported by MICINN supporting the Ramon y Cajal grant for M.A. Prieto (RYC-2017-22891); by Xunta de Galicia for supporting the program EXCELENCIA-ED431F 2020/12 and the predoctoral grant of M.

The urgency of management coral reef systems and associated coastal environments, threatened by the effects of climate change, require a detailed habitat mapping of the present status and a future monitoring of changes over time. Here, we present a remote sensing study using free available Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping at large scale the most sensible and high value habitats (corals, seagrasses, mangroves) of Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean), carried out without any sea truth validation. Remote sensing 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' classification methods applied to 2017 Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m resolution together with comparisons with free ancillary data on web platform and available scientific literature were used to map mangrove, coral, and seagrass communities in the Palau Archipelago. This paper addresses the challenge of multispectral benthic mapping estimation using commercial software for preprocessing steps (ERDAS ATCOR) and for benthic classification (ENVI) on the base of satellite image analysis. The accuracy of the methods was tested comparing results with reference NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA) habitat maps achieved through Ikonos and Quickbird imagery interpretation and sea-truth validations. Results showed how the proposed approach allowed an overall good classification of marine habitats, namely a good concordance of mangroves cover around Palau Archipelago with previous literature and a good identification of coastal habitats in two sites (barrier reef and coastal reef) with an accuracy of 39.8-56.8%, suitable for survey and monitoring of most sensible habitats in tropical remote islands.","[Immordino, Francesco; Candigliota, Elena] ENEA, Div Models & Technol Risks Reduct, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Barsanti, Mattia; Cocito, Silvia; Delbono, Ivana; Peirano, Andrea] ENEA, Div Protect & Enhancement Nat Capital, I-19100 La Spezia, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Peirano, A (通讯作者)，ENEA, Div Protect & Enhancement Nat Capital, I-19100 La Spezia, Italy.",andrea.peirano@enea.it,"Barsanti, Mattia/G-9327-2015; Candigliota, Elena/GVS-6795-2022",,,,,,41,15,16,2,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

The Moroccan Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Cyprinus carpio fishes, living in freshwater and marine environments, were collected at mature and immature stages. The fatty acid (FA) profiles of liver and ovary tissues were investigated by GC-MS and compared with edible fillet tissues. The gonadosomatic index, the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio, and the atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indexes were measured. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found to be abundant in the mature ovary and fillet of both species, with a polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids ratio ranging from 0.40 to 1.06 and a monounsaturated fatty acids/polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio between 0.64 and 1.84. Saturated fatty acids were found to be highly abundant in the liver and gonads of both species (range 30-54%), as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (range 35-58%).

Adsorption processes can be used for the treatment of water contaminated with the heavy metals. Biopolymers are attractive for industrial use due to their adsorptive characteristics, offering efficient metal removal, widespread availability, low cost, and biodegradability. In this work, a chitosan-based biopolymer was tested for the remediation of aquatic systems contaminated with particulate matter and high concentrations of heavy metals. The material, consisting of a two-layer foam, was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, and was applied in the removal of particulate matter and heavy metals from water. Analysis of metals present in the biopolymer wash water and in the supernatant was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The chitosan polymer in Layer B has circular pores, with diameters of 2-20 mu m, while those of Layer A were irregular, with diameters of 100-350 mu m. The biopolymer foam reduced water turbidity by 97% after a contact time of 48 h, and provided high retention of metals, especially iron and silver, with initial concentrations of 200 ppm decreasing to less than 0.6 ppm. The material developed could be used to help in emergencies, including natural and anthropogenic disasters involving collapse of barriers, mining activities, and water pollution with respect to the adsorption of heavy metals and particulate contaminants in these situations. The material is easy to deploy and remove in situations requiring the purification of aquatic environments.","[Neves Ellendersen, Luciana de Souza; Milinsk, Maria Cristina; Feroldi, Michael; Zadinelo, Izabel Volkweis; Gasparrini, Lazaro Jose; Alves, Helton Jose] Univ Fed Parana, Lab Catalise & Prod Biocombustiveis LabCatProBio, Palotina, Parana, Brazil; [dos Santos, Lilian Dena] Univ Fed Parana, Setor Palotina, Programa Posgrad Aquicultura & Desenvolvimento Su, Palotina, Parana, Brazil; [Bolzon de Muniz, Graciela Ines] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Engn Florestal, Av Prof Lothario Meissner 632, BR-80210170 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana; Universidade Federal do Parana,"Ellendersen, LDN (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Lab Catalise & Prod Biocombustiveis LabCatProBio, Palotina, Parana, Brazil.",lucianalsn@gmail.com; mmilinsk@gmail.com; michaelferoldi@gmail.com; izabelzadinelo@gmail.com; liliansantos@ufpr.br; graciela.ufpr@gmail.com; lazarogasparrini@gmail.com; helquimica@gmail.com,"Zadinelo, Izabel/L-4604-2019; de Muniz, Graciela/N-9440-2018; Ellendersen, Luciana/B-8585-2015","Feroldi, Michael/0000-0001-9190-7676; Alves, Helton/0000-0001-6942-1020; Ellendersen, Luciana/0000-0001-9248-3203; Dena dos Santos, Lilian/0000-0003-1637-1300; VOLKWEIS ZADINELO, IZABEL/0000-0002-4025-174X",,,,,27,14,14,3,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2213-3437,,J ENVIRON CHEM ENG,J.

The treatment of WEEE with high content of precious metals (Au in particular) has received the most attention due to their high economic potential. The development of simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective methods for the recovery of metals from low -value WEEE (e.g., <100 g/t Au) is important from the circular economy perspective. In this study, the separation of base (Cu) and precious (Ag) metals from scrap TV boards (STVBs) by using a zig-zag air separator was investigated. Size -reduced scrap STVBs (-1 mm) were subjected to separation tests after the removal of the fine fraction (-0.1 mm). The sized scrap material (-1 +0.1 mm) was determined to have a metal content of 15.4% Cu, 47 g/t Ag and 0.05% Fe, with no gold. In the air separation tests, the effect of air flow rate (4-16 m/s) on the recovery of metals was studied. Increasing the air flow rate resulted in low metal recoveries with concurrent high metal grades in the concentrate. Separation efficiency (%) calculations showed that the most efficient separation is obtained at the highest air flow rate of 16 m/s. At this flow rate, 15.4% of the material was recovered in the concentrate which contains 62.3% Cu and 198 g/t Ag with recoveries of 63.3% Cu and 73.9% Ag. The findings indicated that zig-zag air separators can be used to obtain a metal -rich fraction under suitable conditions of the flow regime.","[Yazici, Ersin Yener; Celep, Oktay; Ibrahim, Boulama Omar Yacine Lawan; Deveci, Haci] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Min Engn, Div Mineral & Coal Proc, Hydromet B&PM Res Grp, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkiye",Karadeniz Technical University,"Yazici, EY (通讯作者)，Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Min Engn, Div Mineral & Coal Proc, Hydromet B&PM Res Grp, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkiye.",eyazici@ktu.edu.tr,"Yazici, Ersin/V-3572-2017; Celep, O./AAW-2957-2020; Deveci, Haci/B-1179-2008","Deveci, Haci/0000-0003-4105-0912",Research Foundation of Karadeniz Technical University (KTU) [FBB-2015-5393],Research Foundation of Karadeniz Technical University (KTU)(Karadeniz Technical University),Acknowledgments The authors would like to express their sincere thanks and appreciation to the Research Foundation of Karadeniz Technical University (KTU) for the financial support (Project no: FBB-2015-5393) .,,35,1,1,1,2,OFICYNA WYDAWNICZA POLITECHNIKI WROCLAWSKIEJ,WROCLAW,"WYBRZEZE WYSPIANSKIEGO 27, 50-370 WROCLAW, POLAND",1643-1049,2084-4735,,PHYSICOCHEM PROBL MI,Physicochem.

One such can be the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in both hospital and community settings, which have been due to an inappropriate use and inadequate control of antibiotics that has led to the foremost human health concerns with a high impact on the global economy. So far, there has been application of two strategies for the development of anti-infective agents either by classical antibiotics that have been derived for their synthetic analogs with increased efficacy or screening natural compounds along with the synthetic compound libraries for the antimicrobial activities. However, need for newer treatment options for infectious diseases has led research to develop new generation of antimicrobial activity to further lessen the spread of antibiotic resistance. Currently, the principles aim to find novel mode of actions or products to target the specific sites and virulence factors in pathogens by a series of better understanding of physiology and molecular aspects of the microbial resistance, mechanism of infection process, and gene-pathogenicity relationship. The design various novel strategies tends to provide us a path for the development of various antimicrobial therapies that intends to have a broader and wider antimicrobial spectrum that helps to combat MDR strains worldwide. The development of antimicrobial peptides, metabolites derived from plants, microbes, phage-based antimicrobial agents, use of metal nanoparticles, and role of CRISPR have led to an exceptional strategies in designing and developing the next-generation antimicrobials. These novel strategies might help to combat the seriousness of the infection rates and control the health crisis system.","[Mayegowda, Shilpa Borehalli; Manjula, N.

It is quintessentially called tree of life owing to its resilience to adverse climatic conditions, along with manifold nutritional-cum-medicinal attributes that comes from its fruits and other plant parts. Being a tree with such immense utility, it has gained substantial attention of tree breeders for its genetic advancement via in vitro biotechnological interventions. Herein, an extensive review of biotechnological research advances in date palm has been consolidated as one of the major research achievements during the past two decades. This article compares the different biotechnological techniques used in this species such as: tissue and organ culture, bioreactor-mediated large-scale propagation, cell suspension culture, embryogenic culture, protoplast culture, conservation (for short- and long-term) of germplasms, in vitro mutagenesis, in vitro selection against biotic and abiotic stresses, secondary metabolite production in vitro, and genetic transformation. This review provides an insight on crop improvement and breeding programs for improved yield and quality fruits; besides, it would undeniably facilitate the tissue culture-based research on date palm for accelerated propagation and enhanced production of quality planting materials, along with conservation and exchange of germplasms, and genetic engineering. In addition, the unexplored research methodologies and major bottlenecks identified in this review should be contemplated on in near future.","[Gantait, Saikat] Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Fac Agr, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Nadia 741252, W Bengal, India; [El-Dawayati, Maiada M.] Agr Res Ctr, Cent Lab Date Palm Res & Dev, 9 Gamma St Giza, Cairo 12619, Egypt; [Panigrahi, Jitendriya] Shri AN Patel Post Grad Inst Sci & Res, Dept Biotechnol, Anand 388001, Gujarat, India; [Labrooy, Catherine] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Crop Sci, Fac Agr, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Verma, Sandeep Kumar] Bolu Abant Izeet Baysal Univ, Dept Biol, Biotechnol Lab, TR-14030 Bolu, Turkey",Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Gantait, S (通讯作者)，Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Fac Agr, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Nadia 741252, W Bengal, India.",saikatgantait@yahoo.com; maiada_dw@hotmail.com; jitenp2001@gmail.com; catherinelabrooy@gmail.com; sandeep.20j@gmail.com,"labrooy, catherine/AAB-2452-2020; Panigrahi, Jitendriya/I-8885-2019; Gantait, Saikat/L-7422-2016","Panigrahi, Dr. Jitendriya/0000-0002-9658-1596; El-Dawayati, Maiada/0000-0002-5311-6950; Gantait, Saikat/0000-0001-5059-2428; Verma, Sandeep Kumar/0000-0002-9324-747X",,,,,204,36,40,2,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0175-7598,1432-0614,,APPL MICROBIOL BIOT,Appl.

Herein, a concept for antimicrobial coatings is developed on the basis of the thermodynamically driven surface concentration of soft block side chains. The concept incorporates structural and compositional guidance from naturally occurring antimicrobial proteins and achieves compositional economy via a polymer-surface modifier (PSM). To implement this concept, polyurethanes were prepared having random copolymer 1,3-propylene oxide soft blocks with alkylammonium and either trifluoroethoxy or PEGlyted side chains. Six carbon (C6) and twelve carbon (C12) alkylammonium chain lengths were used. The PSMs were first tested as 100% coatings and were highly effective against aerosol challenges of Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). To evaluate the surface concentration, solutions containing 2 wt % PSM with a conventional polyurethane were evaporatively coated onto glass slides. These 2% PSM coatings were tested against aerosol challenges of Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria (10(7) CFU/mL/30 min). A copolymer soft block containing trifluorethoxy (89 mol %) and C-12 alkylammonium (11 mol %) side chains gave the highest biocidal effectiveness in 30 min: 2 wt %, Gram(+/-) bacteria, 100% kill, and 3.6-4.4 log reduction. A zone of inhibition test showed no biocide release for PSMs and PSM-modified compositions. Characteristics that contribute to concept validation include good hard block/soft block phase separation, a cation/co-repeat group ratio mimicking natural biocidal proteins, a semifluorinated chaperone aiding in alkylammonium surface concentration, and a low T-g for the alkylammonium soft block.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci Engn, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; Hunter Holmes McGuire Vet Adm Med Ctr, Richmond, VA 23249 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University; Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterinary Affairs Medical Center,"Wynne, KJ (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci Engn, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",kjwynne@vcu.edu,"Kurt, Pinar/KKB-9037-2024",,,,,,44,143,172,2,70,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0743-7463,,,LANGMUIR,Langmuir,APR 24,2007,23,9,,,,,4719,4723,,10.1021/la063718m,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la063718m,,,5,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science,157QX,17388618,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000245736400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sustainable hydrogen generation is crucial for realizing the future hydrogen economy. Acknowledging its potential, Microbial Electrochemical technology has attracted significant research interest. This innovative approach leverages electroactive microbes at the anode to generate hydrogen at the cathode through electrochemical reaction from organic waste or wastewater, making it a promising path for sustainable hydrogen production. In Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), the hydrogen production is facilitated at the cathode. Thus, extensive research emphasizes developing cost-effective and efficient cathodes, with nanomaterials emerging as efficient catalysts due to their unique nanoscale properties. This focus on nanomaterials is advancing MEC technology, making hydrogen production more viable and sustainable for future energy needs. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand the current scenario of nanoparticles as a Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) catalyst and their influence in developing MEC technology. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of MEC and the importance and need of nanoparticles in developing a cost-effective cathode for the advancement of technology. We also discuss the deep insight into the synergistic interactions on the cathode surface and the role of catalytic deposition strategies in HER and their evaluation approaches. Additionally, biofouling of cathode in single chamber MEC and its effect on HER, along with the relative approach of nanoparticles in mitigation strategies has also been focused.

This adsorbent demonstrates superior adsorption capabilities for the efficient removal of hazardous alizarin red s (ARS) and methylene blue (MB) dyes. Thus, it contributes to waste reduction and promotes sustainable practices in environmental remediation, aligning with global efforts to develop sustainable materials that address water pollution while supporting circular economy principles. The structural properties of the activated carbon were characterized through various techniques, including BET surface area, FTIR, SEM, XPS, zeta potential measurements, and determination of the zero-point charge. The characterization results confirmed the preparation of highly porous activated carbon from papaya stems with a high surface area of 1053.52 m2 g-1. The batch experiments revealed that the maximum adsorption capacities for the stem-activated carbon (SAC) were 931 mg g-1 for ARS and 990 mg g-1 for MB. For the leave-activated carbon (LAC), the capacities were 410 mg g-1 for ARS and 642 mg g-1 for MB. SAC exhibited 100% removal of MB or ARS with concentrations lower than 150 ppm in 15 min. The data fitted well with the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, the reusability revealed that the SAC can be reused over 5 cycles without significant change in the removal efficiency. Overall, SAC and LAC derived from papaya plants exhibited excellent dye adsorption performance, suggesting potential for large-scale applications.","[Moheb, Mona; El-Wakil, Ahmad M.; Awad, Fathi S.] Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Chem Dept, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Awad, Fathi S.] New Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Chem Dept, New Mansoura 35712, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University; New Mansoura University,"Awad, FS (通讯作者)，Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Chem Dept, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.;Awad, FS (通讯作者)，New Mansoura Univ, Fac Sci, Chem Dept, New Mansoura 35712, Egypt.",fathyawad949@yahoo.com,"Awad, Fathi S./ITU-7993-2023","Awad, Fathi S./0000-0002-9907-0695",,,,,66,2,2,1,1,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,2046-2069,,RSC ADV,RSC Adv.,JAN 2,2025,15,1,,,,,674,687,,10.1039/d4ra07957d,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d4ra07957d,,,14,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,R4W7Z,39781019,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001391479000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag, and Au mixtures using biomass-derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with a choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents were recycled and reused. The applicability of the developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers, and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for the contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi-metal waste substrates. Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au can be sequentially dissolved from waste electrical and electronic equipment using green oxidants: aqueous H2O2 and Oxone in biomass-derived sustainable and recyclable ionic media: lactic acid and deep eutectic solvent made of choline chloride and urea. This sequential one metal - one method recycling approach closely follows efforts for the security of supply and objectives of circular economy and sustainable development. image","[Zupanc, Anze; Install, Joseph; Heikkilae, Mikko J.; Kemell, Marianna; Repo, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, A I Virtasen Aukio 1, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Weckman, Timo; Melander, Marko M.; Honkala, Karoliina] Univ Jyvaskyla, Nanosci Ctr, Dept Chem, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Jyvaskyla,"Zupanc, A; Repo, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, A I Virtasen Aukio 1, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",anze.zupanc@helsinki.fi; timo.repo@helsinki.fi,"Heikkilä, Mikko/AAG-1141-2021; Honkala, Karoliina/F-9305-2014; Kemell, Marianna/C-1512-2014","Kemell, Marianna/0000-0002-3583-2064; Zupanc, Anze/0000-0002-3697-7839; Install, Joseph/0000-0003-1377-8711; Melander, Marko/0000-0001-7111-1603; Weckman, Timo/0000-0001-8721-560X; Honkala, Karoliina/0000-0002-3166-1077; Repo, Timo/0000-0002-3116-6199; Heikkila, Mikko/0000-0002-6027-2089",Magnus Ehrnroothin Sti; Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation; University of Helsinki; Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation [338228]; Research Council of Finland,Magnus Ehrnroothin Sti; Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation; University of Helsinki; Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Research Council of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"A.

The primary goal of the circular bioeconomy model is to minimize waste by effective re -usage of organic waste and efficient nutrient recycling. In essence, circular bioeconomy integrates the fundamental concept of circular economy, which strives to offer sustainable goods and services by leveraging biological resources and processes. Notably, the circular bioeconomy differs from conventional waste recycling by prioritizing the safeguarding and restoration of production ecosystems, focusing on harnessing renewable biological resources and their associated waste streams to produce value-added products like food, animal feed, and bioenergy. Amidst these sustainability efforts, fruit seeds are getting considerable attention, which were previously overlooked and commonly discarded but were known to comprise diverse chemicals with significant industrial applications, not limited to cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. While, polyphenols in these seeds offer extensive health benefits, the inadequate conversion of fruit waste into valuable products poses substantial environmental challenges and resource wastage. This review aims to comprehend the known information about the application of non -edible fruit seeds for synthesising metallic nanoparticles, carbon dots, biochar, biosorbent, and biodiesel. Further, this review sheds light on the potential use of these seeds as functional foods and feed ingredients; it also comprehends the safety aspects associated with their utilization. Overall, this review aims to provide a roadmap for harnessing the potential of non -edible fruit seeds by adhering to the principles of a sustainable circular bioeconomy.","[Kumar, Harsh; Cimler, Richard] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Ctr Adv Technol, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic; [Kimta, Neetika; Verma, Rachna] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, India; [Guleria, Shivani] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Ctr Relevance & Excellence CORE Agro & Ind Biotec, Dept Biotechnol, TIFAC, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India; [Sethi, Nidhi] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Amritsar 143005, India; [Dhanjal, Daljeet Singh; Singh, Reena] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Bioengn & Biosci, Phagwara 144411, Punjab, India; [Duggal, Sampy] Abhilashi Univ, Dept Ayurveda & Hlth Sci, Mandi 175028, India; [Prerna, Prerna] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Patiala 147001, Punjab, India; [Pathera, Ashok Kumar] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Food Technol, Noida 201313, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Alomar, Suliman Y.] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Zool Dept, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Kuca, Kamil] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic; [Kuca, Kamil] Univ Hosp Hradec Kralove, Biomed Res Ctr, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","University of Hradec Kralove; Shoolini University; Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology; Department of Science & Technology (India); Technology Information, Forecasting & Assessment Council (TIFAC); Guru Nanak Dev University; Lovely Professional University; Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology; Amity University Noida; King Saud University; University of Hradec Kralove; University Hospital Hradec Kralove","Verma, R (通讯作者)，Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, India.;Pathera, AK (通讯作者)，Amity Univ, Amity Inst Food Technol, Noida 201313, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Kuca, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",rachnac83@gmail.com; apathera@gmail.com; kamil.kuca@uhk.cz,"Kuca, Kamil/D-1396-2011; Pathera, Ashok/AAA-7041-2021; Singh, Reena/HHZ-2292-2022; Dhanjal, Daljeet/O-7126-2018; Alomar, Suliman/AGX-1623-2022; Kimta, Neetika/KJL-7625-2024; Verma, Rachna/AAA-6251-2021; Kumar, Harsh/HTP-1859-2023","Kimta, Neetika/0000-0002-9864-4642; Verma, Rachna/0000-0001-5321-9450; Kumar, Harsh/0000-0002-5301-484X","Czech Republic (PrF UHK); MH CZ- DRO (UHHK) [2205/2024-2025]; King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [2205/2024-2025]; [00179906]","Czech Republic (PrF UHK); MH CZ- DRO (UHHK); King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University);","The authors would like to thank the Czech Republic (PrF UHK 2205/2024-2025, MH CZ- DRO (UHHK, 00179906) , along with King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (RSP2023R35) supported this work.",,244,11,11,15,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Catalysts, particularly those utilizing defect engineering involving the strategical introduction of atomic-level imperfections, play a vital role in reducing energy requirements and enabling a more sustainable transition toward a hydrogen-based economy. Stacking fault (SF) defects play an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic processes by reshaping surface reactivity, increasing active sites, improving reactants/product diffusion, and regulating electronic structure due to their dense generation ability and profound impact on catalyst properties. This review explores SF in metal-based materials, covering synthetic methods for the intentional introduction of SF and their applications in hydrogen production, including oxygen evolution reaction, photo- and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and various other electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, this review addresses the challenges associated with SF-based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the properties of SF-based catalysts to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of their various applications in electrocatalytic processes, providing valuable insights for advancing sustainable energy technologies. This review explores the transformative role of stacking fault (SF) defect engineering in catalysts, strategically influencing surface reactivity and modulating electronic structure. This exploration sheds light on the promising applications and major challenges of SF-modified catalysts in hydrogen production and related electrochemical reactions, providing a critical and thorough overview to advance sustainable energy technologies. image","[Wang, Yuan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Chem Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Wang, Yuan; Wang, Tian; Song, Guoqiang; Kawi, Sibudjing] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore 117585, Singapore; [Arandiyan, Hamidreza] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Appl Mat & Ind Chem CAMIC, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Arandiyan, Hamidreza] Univ Sydney, Sch Chem, Lab Adv Catalysis Sustainabil, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Sun, Hongyu] DENSsolut BV, Informaticalaan 12, NL-2628 ZD Delft, Netherlands; [Sabri, Ylias] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Adv Mat & Ind Chem CAMIC, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Zhao, Chuan] Univ New South Wales, Sch Chem, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Shao, Zongping] Curtin Univ, WA Sch Mines Minerals Energy & Chem Engn, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of Melbourne; National University of Singapore; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of New South Wales Sydney; Curtin University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Chem Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.;Wang, Y; Kawi, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Singapore 117585, Singapore.;Arandiyan, H (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Ctr Appl Mat & Ind Chem CAMIC, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.;Arandiyan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Chem, Lab Adv Catalysis Sustainabil, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",helena.wang@unimelb.edu.au; hamid.arandiyan@rmit.edu.au; chekawis@nus.edu.sg,"Arandiyan, Hamid/O-3219-2019; SONG, GUOQIANG/KPY-1176-2024; shao, zongping/B-5250-2013; Zhao, Chuan/CAG-2855-2022; Wang, Yuan (Helena)/J-1882-2015","Zhao, Chuan/0000-0001-7007-5946; Wang, Yuan (Helena)/0000-0002-5215-0487","Australian Research Council; Alfred Deakin Research Fellowship; International Hydrogen Research Fellowship Program; CSIRO; Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Australian Government; Australian Hydrogen Research Network (AHRN); DCCEEW International Clean Innovation Researcher Networks Grant [ICIRN000011]; [DE230100327]; [LP220200583]","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Alfred Deakin Research Fellowship; International Hydrogen Research Fellowship Program; CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Australian Government; Australian Hydrogen Research Network (AHRN); DCCEEW International Clean Innovation Researcher Networks Grant; ;","This study was financially supported by the Alfred Deakin Research Fellowship and the International Hydrogen Research Fellowship Program.

It is, therefore, increasingly important to holistically and dynamically capture the impacts of large-scale energy transitions on resource flows including hidden flows such as mine waste, as well as direct flows. Here we demonstrate a systematic model that can quantify resource flows of both minerals and energy resources under the energy transition by using stock-flow dynamics and the concept of Total Material Requirement (TMR). The proposed model was applied to the International Energy Agency's scenarios up to 2050, targeting 15 electricity generation and 5 transport technologies. Results indicate that the global energy transition could increase TMR flows associated with mineral production by around 200-900% in the electricity sector and 350-700% in the transport sector respectively from 2015 to 2050, depending on the scenarios. Such a drastic increase in TMR flows is largely associated with an increased demand for copper, silver, nickel, lithium and cobalt, as well as steel. Our results highlight that the decarbonization of the electricity sector can reduce energy resource flows and support the hypothesis that the expansion of low-carbon technologies could reduce total resource flows expressed as TMR. In the transport sector, on the other hand, the dissemination of Electric Vehicles could cause a sharp increase in TMR flows associated with mineral production, which could offset a decrease in energy resource flows. Findings in this study emphasize that a sustainable transition would be unachievable without designing resource cycles with a nexus approach.","[Watari, Takuma; McLellan, Benjamin C.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Energy Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Watari, Takuma; Giurco, Damien; Dominish, Elsa] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Yamasue, Eiji] Ritsumeikan Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, 1-1-1 Noji Higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Nansai, Keisuke] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Nansai, Keisuke] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Integrated Sustainabil Anal, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia",Kyoto University; University of Technology Sydney; Ritsumeikan University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Sydney,"Watari, T (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Energy Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",wataritakuma.0930@gmail.com,"Nansai, Keisuke/C-2516-2008; YAMASUE, Eiji/A-3198-2014; McLellan, Benjamin/HLH-5239-2023; Giurco, Damien/C-3631-2009; McLellan, Benjamin/B-7833-2009; Watari, Takuma/AAT-7126-2021","McLellan, Benjamin/0000-0002-4802-3864; Watari, Takuma/0000-0002-6072-3679; Nansai, Keisuke/0000-0002-2449-1874; Dominish, Elsa/0000-0002-5665-6717; Giurco, Damien/0000-0002-1707-9531","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [18KT0056, 18KT0010, 15H02862]; Kyoto University Ishizue Grant; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18KT0010, 15H02862, 18KT0056] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Kyoto University Ishizue Grant; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Research (No. 18KT0056, 18KT0010 and 15H02862) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Kyoto University Ishizue Grant.",,130,200,214,19,166,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

This chapter describes the recent achievements of ruthenium(II) catalysed transformations of sp(2) C-H bonds for cross-coupled C-C bond formation. First arylation and heteroarylation with aromatic halides of a variety of (hetero)arenes, that are directed at ortho position by heterocycle or imine groups, are presented. The role of carboxylate partners is shown for Ru(II) catalysts that are able to operate profitably in water and to selectively produce diarylated or monoarylated products. The alkylation of (hetero)arenes with primary and secondary alkylhalides, and by hydroarylation of alkene C=C bonds is presented. The recent access to functional alkenes via oxidative dehydrogenative functionalization of C-H bonds with alkenes first, and then with alkynes, is shown to be catalysed by a Ru(II) species associated with a silver salt in the presence of an oxidant such as Cu(OAc)(2). Finally the catalytic oxidative annulations with alkynes to rapidly form a variety of heterocycles are described by initial activation of C-H followed by that of N-H or O-H bonds and by formation of a second C-C bond on reaction with C=O, C=N, and sp(3) C-H bonds.

From the circular economy point of view, direct residues from these industries exploited for production of fuel/chemicals is a winning issue, because it reduces the environmental/cost impact and improves the eco-sustainability of productions. Results: The present paper reports recent results of deep eutectic solvent (DES) pretreatment on a selected group of the agro-industrial food wastes (AFWs) produced in Europe. In particular, apple residues, potato peels, coffee silver-skin, and brewer's spent grains were pretreated with two DESs, (choline chloride-glycerol and choline chloride-ethylene glycol) for fermentable sugar production. Pretreated biomass was enzymatic digested by commercial enzymes to produce fermentable sugars. Operating conditions of the DES pretreatment were changed in wide intervals. The solid to solvent ratio ranged between 1:8 and 1:32, and the temperature between 60 and 150 degrees C. The DES reaction time was set at 3 h. Optimal operating conditions were: 3 h pretreatment with choline chloride-glycerol at 1:16 biomass to solvent ratio and 115 degrees C. Moreover, to assess the expected European amount of fermentable sugars from the investigated AFWs, a market analysis was carried out. The overall sugar production was about 217 kt yr(-1), whose main fraction was from the hydrolysis of BSGs pretreated with choline chloride-glycerol DES at the optimal conditions. Conclusions: The reported results boost deep investigation on lignocellulosic biomass using DES. This investigated new class of solvents is easy to prepare, biodegradable and cheaper than ionic liquid. Moreover, they reported good results in terms of sugars' release at mild operating conditions (time, temperature and pressure).","[Procentese, Alessandra; Russo, Maria Elena] CNR, Ist Ric Combust, Ple V Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy; [Raganati, Francesca; Olivieri, Giuseppe; Marzocchella, Antonio] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Chim Mat & Prod Ind, Ple V Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy; [Rehmann, Lars] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie per l'Energia e la Mobilita Sostenibili (STEMS-CNR); University of Naples Federico II; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Procentese, A (通讯作者)，CNR, Ist Ric Combust, Ple V Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",a.procentese@cnr.it,"Raganati, Francesca/J-8950-2019; Russo, Maria Elena/ABA-9907-2020; Rehmann, Lars/H-2703-2014","Procentese, Alessandra/0000-0002-7599-9213; Raganati, Francesca/0000-0002-9988-1164; Rehmann, Lars/0000-0003-3463-6405",European Union [654623],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 654623.

Galling is the surface phenomenon, which involves adhesion of local contact points and creation of protrusions on the surface owing to high friction, inappropriate tribological loading, starved lubrication and high contact pressure (similar to 1000 kPa). All these factors result in severe plastic deformation varying from 8000 mu epsilon to 10,000 mu epsilon (epsilon-Strain) and diffusion of materials into one another, consequently result in fatigue wear, surface roughness and seizing up of critical parts which in response severely affect the service life and economy of the components and shutting down of the system.

Simultaneously, it also deals with the novel and advanced techniques for the mitigation of galling such as design rectification using FEA models, microstructural variation by alloying or heat treatment to enhance the thermal conductivity, use of solid lubricants, hard ceramic coatings such as Titanium nitride and synergistic PTFE incorporated copper or silver coatings having high proficiency against galling, eventually increasing the service life of components without failure and decreasing the capital invested.","[Kakulite, Kalpesh K.; Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian] Minist Def, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Struct Composite Fabricat Lab, Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Pune 411025, Maharashtra, India",Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT),"Kandasubramanian, B (通讯作者)，Minist Def, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Struct Composite Fabricat Lab, Def Inst Adv Technol DU, Pune 411025, Maharashtra, India.",meetkbs@gmail.com,"Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian/M-2709-2014","Kandasubramanian, Balasubramanian/0000-0003-4257-8807",,,,,175,18,19,3,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2468-0230,,,SURF INTERFACES,Surf.

J,"Rothenberg, JR",,,,"Rothenberg, Joan R.",,,In Search of the Silver Bullet: Regulatory Models to Address Childhood Obesity,FOOD AND DRUG LAW JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH; ADOLESCENTS; OVERWEIGHT; TAXES,"The concern over obesity today has evolved beyond an issue of personal vanity to a serious national health issue affecting millions of Americans. Obesity in children is especially alarming. Overweight children and adolescents are at risk for health problems throughout their lives. While under-nutrition or diet insufficiencies were once major obstacles in the development of healthy infants and children, the epidemic of childhood obesity marks the start of the 21st century with equally menacing health consequences. Childhood obesity creates an increased burden of disease on our economy with increased indirect economic costs of time lost from work for parents and time lost from school for the child. Data raise the possibility that the current generation of children could suffer greater illness or experience a shorter lifespan than that of their parents. Some experts believe that government mandated restrictions on dietary choices would alleviate the obesity problem, while others find such actions to be an unwarranted government intrusion. Still, as concerns about obesity continue to grow, especially regarding children, some say government intervention of some type is necessary to solve the problem. This paper examines the history and factors involved in the childhood obesity epidemic, explores regulatory options for its resolution, and provides an overview of obesity as a serious challenge to public health, and the health of children in particular. The federal agencies who share the responsibility for regulating food in the United States and their efforts to address the obesity problem are discussed as a background to various state and federal regulatory models influencing dietary choices. The effectiveness of proposed regulations and alternatives to government intervention suggest that the resolution of the childhood obesity issue requires a coordinated, multilevel approach.","George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Rothenberg, JR (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Law, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,,,,,,,113,4,6,0,5,FOOD DRUG LAW INST,WASHINGTON,"1000 VERMONT AVE NW, SUITE 1200, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4903 USA",1064-590X,,,FOOD DRUG LAW J,Food Drug Law J.,,2010,65,1,,,,,185,+,,,,,,34,Food Science & Technology; Law; Nutrition & Dietetics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Food Science & Technology; Government & Law; Nutrition & Dietetics; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,563AN,24475539,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000275097700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The utilization of bio-nanomaterials as antibiotic allies is a green, economic, sustainable and renewable strategy to combat this pressing issue. These biomaterials involve green precursors (e.g. biowaste, plant extracts, essential oil, microbes, and agricultural residue) and techniques for their fabrication, which reduce their cyto/environmental toxicity and exhibit economic manufacturing, enabling a waste-to-wealth circular economy module. Their nanoscale dimensions with augmented biocompatibility characterize bio-nanomaterials and offer distinctive advantages in addressing AMR. Their ability to target pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, at the molecular level, coupled with their diverse functionalities and bio-functionality doping from natural precursors, allows for a multifaceted approach to combat resistance. Furthermore, bio-nanomaterials can be tailored to enhance the efficacy of existing antimicrobial agents or deliver novel therapies, presenting a versatile platform for innovation. Their use in combination with traditional antibiotics can mitigate resistance mechanisms, prolong the effectiveness of existing treatments, and reduce side effects. This review aims to shed light on the potential of bio-nanomaterials in countering AMR, related mechanisms, and their applications in various domains. These roles encompass co-therapy, nanoencapsulation, and antimicrobial stewardship, each offering a distinct avenue for overcoming AMR. Besides, it addresses the challenges associated with bio-nanomaterials, emphasizing the importance of regulatory considerations. These green biomaterials are the near future of One Health Care, which will have economic, non-polluting, non-toxic, anti-resistant, biocompatible, degradable, and repurposable avenues, contributing to sustainable development goals.","[Barsola, Bindiya; Saklani, Shivani; Kumari, Priyanka] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, India; [Pathania, Diksha] Maharishi Markandeshwar Univ, Dept Biosci & technol MMEC, Ambala 133203, Haryana, India; [Sonu, Sonu; Singh, Pardeep; Raizada, Pankaj] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Adv Chem Sci, Solan 173229, India; [Rustagi, Sarvesh] Uttranchal Univ, Sch Appl & Life Sci, Dehra Dun, Uttrakhand, India; [Moon, Tae Seok] Washington Univ, Dept Energy Environm & Chem Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Kaushik, Ajeet] Florida Polytech Univ, Dept Environm Engn, NanoBioTech Lab, Lakeland, FL USA; [Chaudhary, Vishal] Univ Delhi, Bhagini Nivedita Coll, Phys Dept, Delhi 110043, India; [Chaudhary, Vishal] Chitkara Univ, Ctr Res Impact & Outcome, Chandigarh 140401, Punjab, India","Shoolini University; Maharishi Markandeshwar University; Shoolini University; Uttaranchal University; Washington University (WUSTL); Florida Polytechnic University; University of Delhi; Chitkara University, Punjab","Sonu, S (通讯作者)，Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Adv Chem Sci, Solan 173229, India.;Chaudhary, V (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Bhagini Nivedita Coll, Phys Dept, Delhi 110043, India.;Chaudhary, V (通讯作者)，Chitkara Univ, Ctr Res Impact & Outcome, Chandigarh 140401, Punjab, India.",Sonuchem.12@gmail.com; chaudhary00vishal@gmail.com,"Rustagi, Sarvesh/AEC-1996-2022; Singh, Pardeep/AAI-7740-2020; Chaudhary, Vishal/AHB-2525-2022; Moon, Tae Seok/IXD-7451-2023; Pathania, Diksha/JEO-6751-2023; Raizada, Pankaj/AAY-2035-2020; Barsola, Bindiya/IUP-4453-2023; Saklani, Shivani/LFI-1757-2024; Kaushik, Ajeet/K-1289-2018; , Dr. Sonu/IUN-5181-2023","Kaushik, Ajeet/0000-0003-4206-1541; , Dr. Sonu/0000-0002-4390-5075",British Council (GoingGlobal Academia Industry Partnership)http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000308 [2020-33522-32319]; United States Department of Agriculture; Chitkara University and Uttaranchal University; British Council,British Council (GoingGlobal Academia Industry Partnership)http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000308; United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Chitkara University and Uttaranchal University; British Council(The British Council in India),The authors acknowledge their respective institutes for support and funding.

Guided by the Expectation-Confirmation Model, this article examines older adults' intentions to continue using online physical exercise classes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 adults aged 65 and older who had participated in online physical exercise classes during the pandemic. Transcripts were subject to thematic analysis using the NVivo software program. The results indicate that older adults recognize the usefulness of online physical exercise classes because of their ability to enhance their health and well-being. Their initial expectations were surpassed, and they were generally satisfied with the experience. However, in-person classes remained preferred due to their enhanced benefits. They also felt that the adoption of online classes was involuntary; instead of an autonomous decision guided by their needs and preferences, this was a viable solution imposed by the lockdown. Therefore, their continuance intentions are limited to specific conditions, namely a new lockdown or other physical impediments. Still, considering the flexibility that online physical exercise classes offer, accommodating time and physical constraints, participants highlighted the advantages of a hybrid approach for those who may face challenges attending in-person classes. Based on the findings, this article proposes that ECM provides a relevant, yet insufficient, framework for explaining older adults' continuance intentions for online physical exercise classes, suggesting the inclusion of additional explaining factors: perceived usefulness of non-technological alternatives, necessary conditions, and self-determination.","[Taveira, Francisca; Barbosa, Belem] Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Barbosa, B (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal.",marketing.belem@gmail.com,"Barbosa, Belem/T-2252-2017","Barbosa, Belem/0000-0002-4057-360X",,,,,59,1,1,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-328X,,BEHAV SCI-BASEL,Behav.

The social responsibility of companies related to aging and accessibility has gradually become a topic of concern. To design aging-friendly applications, it is necessary to have better knowledge about older adults' perceptions and experiences of mobile applications. Given the above setting, a user-driven aging design system guide based on the perception system of the elderly has been offered as a solution to the digital divide issues created by the shortcomings in user interface design for aging adults in contemporary China. The Kano model (KANO), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methods are integrated into the design of the aging design guideline. First, a quantitative study was conducted, collecting questionnaires from a total of 100 participants, including 52 individuals aged 41-50, 28 individuals aged 51-60, and 20 individuals aged 60 and above. Second, a qualitative study was carried out involving in-depth interviews with 16 participants aged 50-60. Through the research, 15 user requirements were identified and classified using KANO. Next, AHP was introduced to determine the weights of different attributes of user requirements. Finally, in order to prioritize the design elements, QFD was used to identify the design elements that needed emphasis during the design process. This study provides a basis for the perceptual information interaction of Chinese older adults within smartphone systems, offering standardized guidance for subsequent researchers in user-centered interaction design for the elderly, ultimately enhancing the well-being of the elderly.","[Wang, Zhuo] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Wang, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.",zhuowang210@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,7,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-031-61542-9; 978-3-031-61543-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2024,14725,,,,,,100,113,,10.1007/978-3-031-61543-6_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-61543-6_8,,,14,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Ergonomics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Engineering,BX3PM,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001283796600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.","[Hu, Ming; Shi, Mengze] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Pavlin, J.

This study introduces a novel approach to e-waste recycling by utilizing electrochemical exfoliation (ECE) to produce graphene oxide (GO) from discarded dry cells, composed of graphite core, followed by its reduction to reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Since GO and rGO have dynamic physicochemical properties making them suitable candidates for the adsorption and extraction process. The ECE method is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective, offering a green alternative to traditional synthesis methods that involve hazardous chemicals and lengthy processes. GO and rGO were employed as adsorbents to extract gold (Au) and silver (Ag) from the central processing units (CPUs) of old laptops. Characterizations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy, Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (FESEM-EDS) confirmed the structural and morphological properties of the graphene derivatives. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that GO and rGO effectively adsorbed PMs, while former showed superior efficiency due to abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and dispersion stability. The promising potential of adsorbents was demonstrated with exceptionally high extraction efficiency and selectivity for PMs rather than heavy metals (Cu). Post-adsorption samples were analyzed using Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), FTIR, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and FESEM-EDS mapping, and the mechanism was proposed. This method supports the circular economy by turning e-waste into valuable resources, contributing to more sustainable e-waste management practices.","[Hayat, Mamoona; Waseem, Muhammad; Arif, Saira; Sattar, Abdul; Dilpazir, Sobia] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Chem, Islamabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Junaid; Tabassam, Lubna] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Phys, Optoelect Res Lab, Islamabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hussain, Khadim] Geol Survey Pakistan, Geosci Adv Res Labs, Islamabad, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Arif, S (通讯作者)，COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Chem, Islamabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",saira.arif@comsats.edu.pk,"Sattar, Abdul/LGY-8650-2024; Waseem, Muhammad/Z-4605-2019; Arif, Saira/MTE-7438-2025; Dilpazir, Sobia/F-3462-2018","Arif, Saira/0000-0001-7227-4324",Higher Education Commission of Pakistan [ASIP/R & D/HEC/2023/5/22888/189],Higher Education Commission of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"We gratefully acknowledge Higher Education Commission of Pakistan for providing us financial assistance through Access to Scientific Instruments Program (Letter No :ASIP/R & D/HEC/2023/5/22888/189) to characterize the samples and extend our sincere appreciation to HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi as well as the chemical section of Geosciences Advance Research Laboratories, Geological Survey of Pakistan, for their assistance in facilitating our analysis.

This article explores whether this apparent irreconcilability can be resolved. It is investigated how far the extraction rate of thirteen scarce raw materials can be reduced while simultaneously increasing the services they provide worldwide to the level prevailing in developed countries in 2020. The scarce raw materials considered are antimony, bismuth, boron, chromium, copper, gold, indium, molybdenum, nickel, silver, tin, tungsten, and zinc. Indicative estimates of how long these mineral resources will be available for humanity are calculated, assuming (1)the world population stabilizes at ten billion people, (2) the global service level of these resources attains that prevailing in developed countries in 2020 and (3) maximum resource-saving measures are taken. The conclusion is that immediate implementation of the most stringent resource-saving measures could extend the estimated exhaustion periods of most of the scarcest raw materials by an average factor of approximately four, even while simultaneously increasing the global service level of these resources by a factor four as well. Without sufficient and adequate resource saving measures it will be difficult or impossible for a substantial part of the future world population to attain the service level of mineral resources prevailing in developed countries at this moment. Moreover, without such measures, the period of time that future citizens of rich countries can continue enjoying the current service level of some of the scarcest mineral resources in their countries, will be severely limited.","[Henckens, Theo] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Henckens, T (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",M.L.C.M.Henckens@uu.nl,,,,,,,83,74,75,9,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Although OLED consists mostly of organic substances, because it was developed to reduce the consumptions of rare and precious metals, OLED display has a possibility to contain more metal-based components than LCD; for instance, a pixel circuit for OLED needs two thin-film transistors (TFTs), whereas that for LCD does one. Thus, this study was intended to assess and compare possible environmental impacts due to metals in an OLED display and an LCD on a same screen size basis, to examine environmental effects of the technology transition. Hazardous waste potentials at end-of-life were examined based on metal leachability tests, and resource depletion and toxicity potentials were evaluated based on life cycle impact assessment methods. The leachability test results showed that the OLED display has higher hazardous potential than an LCD due to excessive levels of leachability for many metals under California state regulation. The OLED display had 1000-2300 times higher resource depletion potentials than the LCD due primarily to the high concentrations of gold, selenium, silver, palladium, and tin.

That is the case of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose and haloacetic acid disinfection byproducts such as trichloroacetic acid (TCA), classified as contaminants of emerging concern. This motivates the search for rapid, cost-effective and easy-to-use analytical tools that could be deployed to facilitate the analysis of organohalide pollutants and aid in accurately monitoring water quality. This work explores the rapid detection of sucralose and TCA using a very simple miniaturized sample-to-result integrated electrochemical sensor. The device incorporates a screen-printed three-electrode electrochemical cell (SPE) where the working electrode is made of a nanocomposite of Ag nanoparticles and porous C (Ag/C). The material is prepared from bread waste, in an attempt to add value to one of the largest fractions of food leftovers and thus contribute to the sustainable circular economy. The electrochemical process behind the sensor analytical performance is initially evaluated using free Cl- ions in solution and then, the sensor is used to analyze the mentioned target analytes. A paper disk integrated over the electrode area and loaded with the reagents required for the sample conditioning makes the analysis straightforward. The sensor thus produced can be inserted in a highly compact low-power instrument connected to a mobile phone, making an easy-to-use device suitable for on-site analytical studies.","[Duan, Wenchao; Gich, Marti] Inst Ciencia Mat Barcelona, ICMAB, CSIC, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Duan, Wenchao; Fernandez-Sanchez, Cesar] Inst Microelectron Barcelona, IMB, CSIC, CNM, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Baez-Gaxiola, Martha Raquel] SMARTER Lab Nucleus Res & Divulgat AC, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; [Fernandez-Sanchez, Cesar] CIBER Bioingn Biomat & Nanomed CIBER BBN, Jordi Girona 18-26, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Barcelona (ICMAB); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Microelectronica de Barcelona (IMB-CNM); CSIC - Centro Nacional de Microelectronica (CNM); Autonomous University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERBBN,"Gich, M (通讯作者)，Inst Ciencia Mat Barcelona, ICMAB, CSIC, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Fernández-Sánchez, C (通讯作者)，Inst Microelectron Barcelona, IMB, CSIC, CNM, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Fernández-Sánchez, C (通讯作者)，CIBER Bioingn Biomat & Nanomed CIBER BBN, Jordi Girona 18-26, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",mgich@icmab.es,"Duan, Wenchao/HGA-4703-2022; Duan, Wenchao/C-4263-2018; Fernandez-Sanchez, Cesar/N-5846-2014; Gich, Marti/H-7179-2012","Duan, Wenchao/0000-0001-5669-9285; Fernandez-Sanchez, Cesar/0000-0003-2779-9281; Gich, Marti/0000-0001-9958-0057",Chinese Scholarship Council fellowship [201806220063]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Severo Ochoa program for Centers of Excellence in RD [CEX2019-000917-S],"Chinese Scholarship Council fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Severo Ochoa program for Centers of Excellence in RD",The Chinese Scholarship Council fellowship (201806220063) to W.

A theme central to industrial ecology is the way that materials are used which, in turn, relates to environmental and resource availability concerns. The material fluxes seen between the production of raw materials, the manufacture and use of products, and their fate at their end of life are quantified using material flow analysis, the record keeping of atoms mobilized by humans within a bounded system. The Stocks and Flows project at Yale University examines the full life cycle of anthropogenically mobilized material on a variety of spatial levels, including city-, country-, regional-, and global-level cycles. Different temporal levels are also examined, with research conducted on historical studies, contemporary studies, and scenario development. Material cycles have been completed for copper, zinc, and silver, with current work including iron and steel, chromium, nickel, tungsten, tin, and lead cycles. Such results illuminate the numerous and diverse drivers for constructing technological material cycles: global and local material scarcity, human health and ecosystem effects, energy and water consumption, high unit value of the material, pertinent regulations, waste management strategies, and economic considerations. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of selected topics in the field of industrial ecology, to gather from diverse literature key results from the Stocks and Flows project, and to introduce novel analyses related to environmental losses and waste streams that result from anthropogenic use of materials. This is done with the intent to emphasize to the environmental engineering and science audience what may be termed forward-looking environmental engineering.","Yale Univ, Ctr Ind Ecol, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Yale Univ, Environm Engn Program, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Harper, EM (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Ctr Ind Ecol, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 205 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",ermelinda.harper@yale.edu,"Johnson, Jeremiah/F-3505-2013","Graedel, Thomas E/0000-0002-4007-3189; Johnson, Jeremiah/0000-0002-9602-4976",,,,,63,21,22,4,70,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1092-8758,1557-9018,,ENVIRON ENG SCI,Environ.

This study also examines an important paradox: whether investing in both exploitation and exploration practices is conflicting or complementary to enabling SC resilience and robustness in the presence of SCC.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a survey-based approach to collect 242 useful responses from SC professionals of Pakistani firms, an important emerging economy context. The data were analysed with covariance-based structural equation modelling to statistically validate the model.FindingsThe analysis reveals several key findings: the presence of SCC has a direct, positive influence on SC resilience and SC robustness; while exploitation practices only partially mediate the nexus between SCC and SC resilience, they fully mediate the relationship between SCC and SC robustness; while exploration practices partially mediate the nexus between SCC and SC resilience, they do not mediate the relationship between SCC and SC robustness and SCC has a significant influence on SC resilience and SC robustness sequentially through exploitation and exploration (i.e. one after the other).Practical implicationsThese findings help to reconcile the exploitation versus exploration paradox in cultivating SC resilience and SC robustness in the presence of SCC. The findings assist SC managers in determining how to deploy their limited resources most effectively to enhance SC resilience and SC robustness while facing SCC.Originality/valueThe authors devise and empirically validate a unique framework that demonstrates how the presence of SCC works as a stimulus to build SC resilience and SC robustness.","[Iftikhar, Anas; Stevenson, Mark] Univ Lancaster, Dept Management Sci, Lancaster, England; [Ali, Imran] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Business & Law, Melbourne, Australia",Lancaster University; Central Queensland University,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Management Sci, Lancaster, England.",m.stevenson@lancaster.ac.uk,"Iftikhar, Anas/GQB-0179-2022; Ali, Imran/O-5404-2019; Stevenson, Mark/JZD-4224-2024","Iftikhar, Anas/0000-0002-1383-0957",,,,,105,10,10,16,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1359-8546,1758-6852,,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,Supply Chain Manag.,FEB 22,2024,29,2,,,,,244,259,,10.1108/SCM-01-2023-0022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-01-2023-0022,,NOV 2023,16,Business; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,IQ2Y9,,Green Accepted,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001109475200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A synthetic solution simulating Zn process solution containing 65 g/L Zn, 200 ppm Cu, 2 ppm Ag and 10 g/L H2SO4 was used as the source for creating functional surfaces EDRR experiments. The effects of operating parameters such as deposition potential (E1), deposition time (t1), and redox replacement time (t2) have been comprehensively studied. When E1 was selected to deposit Zn as the sacrificial metal, coherent Cu/Zn/ Ag coatings with various chemical compositions, crystalline phases and surface morphology were obtained depending on the selected t1 and t2. The Cu/Zn/Ag coatings also exhibited competitive corrosion resistance (Ecorr = -683 to -634 mV vs. Hg/Hg2SO4, jcorr = 1.6-4.1 mu A/cm2) when compared to those detailed in the literature. In contrast, when E1 was selected so that Cu was the sacrificial metal, separated Cu/Ag particles with controllable chemical composition, particle size (82-170 nm) and tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) behavior were formed through the variation of t1 and t2. In addition to the ability to tailor different functionalities for the surfaces from the same solutions, the process was performed in a single electrochemical cell without the addition of any complexing agents. Overall, these promising results demonstrated the versatility of the EDRR method to create various high value-added functional materials from complex hydrometallurgical solutions which contain multiple metal impurities.","[Wang, Zulin; Wilson, Benjamin P.; Lundstom, Mari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn CMET, POB 16200, Vuorimiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Yliniemi, Kirsi] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Mat Sci CMAT, POB 16100,Kemistintie 1, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Lundstom, M (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn CMET, POB 16200, Vuorimiehentie 2, Espoo 02150, Finland.",mari.lundstrom@aalto.fi,"Yliniemi, Kirsi/I-7897-2012; Wilson, Benjamin/A-4974-2010","Yliniemi, Kirsi/0000-0003-2536-388X; Wilson, Benjamin/0000-0002-2874-6475","Academy of Finland project [319691, 339979]; Academy of Finland; Chinese Scholarship Council [201706370244]; Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion [8188]",Academy of Finland project(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion,"Academy of Finland project (GoldTail (319691) BW) and EARMetal (339979, ML, KY) are greatly acknowledged for funding this research.

Here, we report a novel silver-graphene (Ag-G) modified TiO2 (Ag-G-TiO2) nanocomposite photocatalyst that demonstrates remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for both dye wastewater degradation and hydrogen production under visible and UV light irradiation. Through comprehensive characterization and performance analysis, we reveal that the Ag-G modification narrows the TiO2 bandgap from 3.12 eV to 1.79 eV, enabling efficient visible light absorption. The nanocomposite achieves a peak hydrogen production rate of 191 mu molesg(-1)h(-1) in deionized (DI) water dye solution under visible light, significantly outperforming unmodified TiO2. Intriguingly, we observe an inverse relationship between dye degradation efficiency and hydrogen production rates in dye solutions with tap water versus DI water, highlighting the critical role of water composition in photocatalytic processes. This work not only advances the understanding of fundamental photocatalytic mechanisms but also presents a promising photocatalyst for solar-driven environmental remediation and clean energy production. The Ag-G-TiO2 nanocomposite's enhanced performance across both visible and UV spectra, coupled with its dual functionality in dye degradation and hydrogen evolution, represents a significant step towards addressing critical challenges in water treatment and sustainable energy generation. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between light absorption and reaction conditions, offering new insights for optimizing photocatalytic systems.

Innovation is often considered critical to increasing resilience in wood-based value chains. However, the knowledge about types of innovation processes and how they enhance resilience, if at all, is largely dispersed. In this conceptual paper, we refer to examples from the forestry, bioeconomy, adaptation, and innovation literature to develop an overview of innovation pathways along the wood value chain. Thereafter, we evaluate the extent to which they enhance or compromise resilience to climate change and how they do so.Recent FindingsWe differentiate between forest and value chain resilience and assume that innovation positively influences both types of resilience via three resilience drivers: diversifying the product portfolio, making operations more efficient, or making the processes more flexible. Our literature review revealed nine innovation pathways along the value chain.The pathways rarely connect forest management and the processing industry. Consequently, a mismatch was identified between the innovation pathways and resilience drivers applied to increase diversification at the beginning of the value chain (in forest management) and those applied to increase efficiency towards the end of the value chain (in the processing industry). Considering this mismatch, we stress that it is critical to reconsider the term innovation as a silver bullet and to increase the awareness of resilience drivers and innovation pathways, as well as reconsider ways to combine them optimally. We recommend engaging in open innovation activities to cooperatively draft innovation strategies across the entire wood value chain and intercept pathways by making processes more flexible.","[Hoeben, Annechien Dirkje; Stern, Tobias] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Lloret, Francisco] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Lloret, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Unitat Ecol, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain",University of Graz; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Hoeben, AD (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",Annechien.Hoeben@uni-graz.at,"Stern, Tobias/V-9665-2017; Lloret, francisco/A-2320-2015; Hoeben, Annechien Dirkje/JCD-9348-2023; Lloret, Francisco/H-2711-2015","Hoeben, Annechien Dirkje/0000-0001-9070-9213; Lloret, Francisco/0000-0002-9836-4069",University of Graz; RESONATE Project - European Union [101000574],University of Graz; RESONATE Project - European Union,Open access funding provided by University of Graz.

Efficient hydrogen evolution would play an important role in a sustainable fuel economy, and molecular systems could serve as highly specific and tunable alternatives to traditional noble metal surface catalysts. However, molecular catalysts are currently mostly used in homogeneous setups, where quantitative evaluation of catalytic activity is non-standardized and cumbersome, in particular for multistep, multielectron processes. The molecular design community would therefore be well served by a straightforward model for prediction and comparison of the efficiency of molecular catalysts. Recent developments in this area include attempts at applying the Sabatier principle and the volcano plot concept - popular tools for comparing metal surface catalysts - to molecular catalysis. In this work, we evaluate the predictive power of these tools in the context of experimental operating conditions, by applying them to a series of tetraphenylporphyrins employed as molecular electrocatalysts of the HER. We show that the binding energy of H and the redox chemistry of the porphyrins depend solely on the electron withdrawing ability of the central metal ion, and that the thermodynamics of the catalytic cycle follow a simple linear free energy relation. We also find that the catalytic efficiency of the porphyrins is almost exclusively determined by reaction kinetics and therefore cannot be explained by thermodynamics alone. We conclude that the Sabatier principle, linear free energy relations and molecular volcano plots are insufficient tools for predicting and comparing activity of molecular catalysts, and that experimentally useful information of catalytic performance can still only be obtained through detailed knowledge of the catalytic pathway for each individual system.","[Zaar, Felicia; Stromme, Maria; Sjodin, Martin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Div Nanotechnol & Funct Mat, Box 35, SE-75103 Uppsala, Sweden; [Araujo, C.

An economy often focuses on sources of high-quality material/energy first produced by nature for increasing growth. World heritages sites (WHSs) have become major tourist attractions that promote economic development for developing countries. The increased number of tourists has thus brought about threats to ecological environment. Scholars stress that it should be sustainable or green growth since it comes to economic growth currently. The aim of this research is to establish a sustainable development model for WHSs to empirically investigate the dilemma between economic development and ecological protection with particular emphasis on strategies that promote the sustainability. The study took China's 45 WHSs as samples and constructed a two-stage sustainable development model to analyze the trade-off between economic development and ecological protection. The dynamic network slacks-based measure was employed for dynamic performance evaluation for the period 2013-2019. The results suggest that a strong balance between economic development and ecological protection would be essential for sustainability. Spearman's rank correlation was also used to verify that there are no conflicts between the two processes. In addition, this study demonstrates that an effective government policy covering regulations of economic development and ecological protection can positively influence sustainable development. The governments are suggested to improve the section that the WHS performs inefficient. Involvement of balanceable sustainable development for WHSs needs necessary cooperation during concerned institutions, practitioners, and communities. The WHSs are recommended to receive strict standard of supervision, management, and control.","[Lin, Bie-Yu] Taizhou Vocat Coll Sci &Technol, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shi-Xiao] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, SX (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",linbieyu@outlook.com; tuoniaoe@gmail.com,"Wang, Shi-Xiao/AAB-6491-2020","Wang, Shi-Xiao/0000-0001-6851-9069",2022 Social Science Planning Project of Foshan City; [2022-GJ042],2022 Social Science Planning Project of Foshan City;,AcknowledgmentsThis study was funded by the 2022 Social Science Planning Project of Foshan City.

Using the Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) (d(i) + r(i) = central degree, d(i)-r(i) = cause degree) this study reveals that the core dimension for evaluating smart office buildings more sustainable is the technological dimension (D-4) (34.007, 0.967), followed by the economic dimension (D-2) (38.725, 0.175) and the socio-cultural dimension (D-3) (37.743, 0.047); improvements to these three dimensions drives the environmental dimension (D-1) (48.694, -1.190). In terms of the criteria, automation (C-8) (19.328, 0.587), interactivity (C-9) (14.679, 0.380), waste management (C-3) (13.884, 0.300), architectural innovation (C-7) (18.882, 0.226) and affordability (C-4) (19.070, 0.201) are five critical criteria.

The number of metals in these boards can vary according to the model, year of manufacture, and function, making these scraps a complex residue for the application of recovery routes. In the present study, the leaching process was evaluated as an alternative to the magnetic separation step of the current hydrometallurgical routes for the recovery of iron and copper in these waste in which recovery of the metals present was carried out. The first stage of the hydrometallurgical route was leaching in sulfuric acid, for the recovery of iron. Subsequently, the copper recovery study was carried out, through the second stage of acid leaching in an oxidizing medium. The third stage was carried out in a nitric medium for the solubilization of the remaining metals. After using the same solid/liquid ratio for the solubilization of the metals present in the two types of boards, it was found that for the board with the highest concentration of metals that this ratio should be changed for greater extraction results. The percentage of leaching for the motherboard samples increased (to about 98 wt%) together with the residue/ acid ratio, and this showed that for each type of waste, according to its composition, the metal/acid ratio must be established for complete solubilization of the metals of interest. The recovery of this waste, depending on the type of scrap, can reach at least US$ 1,230,000.00 /t waste.","[Goncalves Martins, Thamiris Auxiliadora; Soares Tenorio, Jorge Alberto; Romano Espinosa, Denise Crocce] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Chem Engn, Polytech Sch, Lago St 250, BR-05508080 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Kohler Caldas, Marcos Paulo] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Espirito Santo IFES, Rodovia ES-010,Km 6-5, BR-29173087 Serra, ES, Brazil; [de Moraes, Viviane Tavares] Maua Inst Technol, Praca Maua 1, BR-09580900 Sao Caetano do Sul, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Instituto Federal do Espirito Santo (IFES); Instituto Maua de Tecnologia,"Martins, TAG (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Chem Engn, Polytech Sch, Lago St 250, BR-05508080 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",thamirisagm@usp.br,"Tenório, Jorge/S-2197-2019; Espinosa, Denise/C-6104-2012; de moraes, viviane/P-9536-2017; Tenorio, Jorge/B-2585-2015","Tenorio, Jorge/0000-0002-7849-7470","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001, 2019/11866-5, 2012/51871-9, 2018/07461-7]; University of Sao Paulo; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil [2019/11866-5, 2012/51871-9, 2018/07461-7]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil [306936/2016-0]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); University of Sao Paulo; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brazil(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.

The agrowastes are often disposed indiscriminately or burnt off, thereby constituting environmental menace and contribute to global warming through the generation of greenhouse gases. Most frequently, the biomasses despite their richness in nutrients are also not found suitable for deserving applications. Among the agrowastes, generation of corncob occupies a prime position due to large scale cultivation of maize worldwide, as more than 200 million tons of corncobs are produced yearly. In recent times, to achieve environmental sustainability, value-addition to wastes, and promotion of advances in bio- and circular economy, agrowastes are now being investigated for valorization through biotechnological route. The preponderance of microbes with their concomitant production of different varieties of degradative enzymes makes them suitable for bioconversion of agrowastes to viable bioproducts in eco-friendly manner. The valorization of agrowastes is in direct responses to achieving five of the goals of SDG; particularly good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), industry and innovation (SDG 9), and climate action (SDG 13). In this review, we present recent activities on biotechnological valorization of corncob to create new range of bio- and nanoproducts to stimulate more research endeavours in this area.

Thus, the importance of biosafety is once again being valued worldwide. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, most national governments have been encouraged to speed up the development of biosafety, which places higher requirements on researchers in biosafety and relevant fields. Many problems have been exposed due to the outbreak of COVID-19, including unavailability of effective drugs and vaccines, difficulty in fast or real-time virus detection, insufficient protective equipment, and shortage of transportation equipment for infected patients. To a certain extent, these biosafety problems are partly due to the limited biosafety-related research in materials science. Currently, the tremendous research efforts in materials science around the world have provided a wide variety of materials with peculiar properties to solve biosafety problems. This review attempts to give a perspective on how the development of novel materials can help scientists tackle the challenges in biosafety. Considering the importance of materials science in the biosafety field, it is urgent for us to officially propose the brand new concept of biosafety materials, which can be a future scientific discipline that utilizes materials science and theory simultaneously to produce materials, related products, and equipment to solve biosafety problems. Herein, we have aimed to draw worldwide attention on the new discipline of biosafety materials and the active cooperation between materials scientists and biosafety-related scientists to propel its development.","[Yu, Yingjie; Zhou, Huiling; Wang, Yongheng; Xiao, Haihua] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, State Key Lab Polymer Phys & Chem, Inst Chem, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yingjie; Zhou, Huiling; Xiao, Haihua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yingjie; Nie, Guohui] Shenzhen Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Inst Translat Med, Shenzhen Peoples Hosp 2,Affiliated Hosp 1, Shenzhen 518035, Peoples R China; [Bu, Fanqiang; Wang, Xing] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Beijing Lab Biomed Mat, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Cui, Jianxun] HEBEI Flance Nanotechnol Co Ltd, Dingzhou 073000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Shenzhen University; Beijing University of Chemical Technology","Xiao, HH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, State Key Lab Polymer Phys & Chem, Inst Chem, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Xiao, HH (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",hhxiao@iccas.ac.cn,"zhou, Huiling/JHT-5943-2023; bu, fanqiang/LTF-1972-2024; Xiao, Haihua/ABC-2574-2021",", Prof. Xing Wang/0000-0002-9990-1479; Xiao, Haihua/0000-0001-8159-8187; Bu, Fanqiang/0009-0003-8819-5905",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51873218],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51873218).,,207,52,58,7,68,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",,2052-1537,,MATER CHEM FRONT,Mat.

Taking into consideration that the main route of virus transmission is via respiratory particles, the face mask represents a simple and efficient barrier between potentially infected and healthy individuals, thus reducing transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles. However, long-term usage of a face mask leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of different pathogens and viruses onto the surface of the mask and can result in dangerous bacterial and viral co-infections. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) has recently emerged as an efficient water-stable photocatalyst capable of generating reactive oxygen species under light irradiation destroying dangerous microbial pathogens. The present study investigates the potential of using ZIF-8 as a coating for face masks to prevent the adherence of microbial/viral entities. The results show that after 2 h of UV irradiation, a polypropylene mask coated with ZIF-8 nanostructures is capable of eliminating S. Aureus and bacteriophage MS2 with 99.99% and 95.4% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, low-pathogenic HCoV-OC43 coronavirus was eliminated by a ZIF-8-modified mask with 100% efficiency already after 1 h of UV irradiation.

However, developing cost-effective, environmentally friendly and selective gram-scale catalysts, in full agreement with circular economy and green chemistry principles, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report on MFe12O19 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as a novel, magnetically recoverable and selective catalyst for the oxidation of olefins. Three different MFe12O19 (M = Cu, Sn and Sr) MNPs were synthesized using the coprecipitation method and characterized by XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, SEM-EDX, TEM, BET, zeta potential and 57Fe M & ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy. XRD analysis demonstrates that the patterns of SnFe12O19 and CuFe12O19 are totally different from those of the magnetoplumbite hexaferrite structure due to the confirmed coexistence by Rietveld refinements of SnO2-Fe2O3 and CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 as composite structures, respectively. In good agreement, Raman studies exclusively confirms the coexistence of MOx-Fe2O3 as a composite structure in MFe12O19, due to the presence of alpha-Fe2O3 and gamma-Fe2O3 as intermediate phases during the formation process of the hexaferrite structure. Moreover, the XPS and M & ouml;ssbauer results are consistent with the experimental evidence and spectroscopic characterizations. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of the as-synthesized MNPs was evaluated for the oxidation of styrene as a model olefinic substrate. Among the as-prepared MFe12O19 MNPs, the composite structure CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 in CuFe12O19 effectively enhances catalytic activity, selectivity and reusability due to the synergistic catalytic effect within a single magnetically recoverable nanostructure. Overall, MFe12O19 MNPs present a facile and greener approach using magnetically recyclable hexaferrites for selective catalytic oxidation reactions.","[Laayati, Mouhsine; El Houssame, Soufiane] Univ Sultan Moulay Slimane, Fac Polydisciplinaire Khouribga, Lab Sci Mat Math & Environm, BP 145, Khouribga 25000, Morocco; [Laayati, Mouhsine; Mekkaoui, Ayoub Abdelkader; El Firdoussi, Larbi] Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia Marrakech, Dept Chim, Equipe Chim Coordinat Catalyse,UCA,Lab Chim Mol, BP 2390, Marrakech 40001, Morocco; [Yalin, Ahsen Sare; Metin, Onder] Koc Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkiye; [El Boubekri, Abdelhamid; Sajieddine, Mohammed] Univ Sultan Moulay Slimane, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Genie Energet Mat, BP 523, Beni Mellal 23000, Morocco; [Laayati, Mouhsine; Neels, Antonia] Empa Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol, Ctr X Ray Analyt, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Metin, Onder] Koc Univ, Koc Univ Surface Sci & Technol Ctr KUYTAM, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkiye",Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal; Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech; Koc University; Sultan Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Koc University,"El Houssame, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sultan Moulay Slimane, Fac Polydisciplinaire Khouribga, Lab Sci Mat Math & Environm, BP 145, Khouribga 25000, Morocco.;Mekkaoui, AA (通讯作者)，Cadi Ayyad Univ, Fac Sci Semlalia Marrakech, Dept Chim, Equipe Chim Coordinat Catalyse,UCA,Lab Chim Mol, BP 2390, Marrakech 40001, Morocco.",mekk.ayoub@gmail.com; hous_soufiane@hotmail.com,"MEKKAOUI, Ayoub Abdelkader/AAL-7975-2020; Metin, Onder/X-2448-2019","Metin, Onder/0000-0003-1622-4992; Mekkaoui, Ayoub Abdelkader/0000-0002-7336-1961",,,,,64,0,0,0,0,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2516-0230,,,NANOSCALE ADV,Nanoscale Adv.,2025 MAR 25,2025,,,,,,,,,,10.1039/d5na00167f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d5na00167f,,MAR 2025,17,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,1JS1D,40242200,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001466645600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using polyethylene glycol (PEG)/deionized water as a solvent mitigates these issues, by leveraging PEG's high solubility, bio-compatibility, low cost, and redox properties. The synthesis conditions were optimized, resulting in relatively uniform AgNC. The synthetic AgNC were loaded on porous, cheap, flexible and biocompatible filter paper (FP) by a simple self- assembly, and the formed flexible substrate (AgNC@FP) was used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. The AgNC@FP substrate had a high enhancement factor (EF) of 9.8 x 107, with a detection limit of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) of 5.2 x 10-12 M. Meanwhile, the substrate showed good reproducibility and stability, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 5.9 % and a decrease in Raman signal strength of only 25 % after 30 days. Furthermore, the direct sampling of apples and pears from their surface thereby enables the rapid identification of ultra-low thiram residue concentrations, with a sensitivity of 8.3 x 10-7 M. The high SERS enhancement factor and sensitivity were attributed to the result of the high hot spot density generated by the FP surface, excellent uniformity and superior sample collection efficiency. It can therefore be concluded that this flexible AgNC@FP substrate, which is manufactured at a low cost and allows for label-free SERS detection, represents a promising SERS platform for analytical and biosensing applications.","[Wang, Tao; Zhang, Shuang; Wu, Dongling; He, Yalan] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Chem & Utilizat Carbon substrated En, Urumqi 830017, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao] Xinjiang Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Urumqi 830017, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Maohua] Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Reg Prod Qual Supervis &, Key Lab Improvised Explos Chem State Market Regula, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yunpeng] Xinjiang Univ, Ctr Innovat Management Res, Sch Econ & Management, Xinjiang 830047, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yunpeng] Yili Chuanning Biotechnol Co Ltd, State Environm Protect Engn Ctr Harmless Treatment, Xinjiang 835007, Peoples R China",Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University,"Wu, DL (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Chem & Utilizat Carbon substrated En, Urumqi 830017, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.;Shen, YP (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ, Ctr Innovat Management Res, Sch Econ & Management, Xinjiang 830047, Peoples R China.;Shen, YP (通讯作者)，Yili Chuanning Biotechnol Co Ltd, State Environm Protect Engn Ctr Harmless Treatment, Xinjiang 835007, Peoples R China.",wudl@xju.edu.cn; johnshen0707@163.com,"李, 茂华/HGU-6543-2022",,Key research and development in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region [2023B03008-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [22269022],Key research and development in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The projects of key research and development in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (No. 2023B03008-1) , and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22269022) .",,30,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0026-265X,1095-9149,,MICROCHEM J,Microchem J.,FEB,2025,209,,,,,,,,112656,10.1016/j.microc.2025.112656,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2025.112656,,FEB 2025,8,"Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry,W6T9N,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001419885100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dyes are majorly organic compounds used by various industries as an identifier, colorant or for aesthetic purposes. Effluents discharged by such industries containing dyes may change the physical, chemical and biological properties of water in long run which causes adverse impacts on the ecosystem. While in humans and other aquatic animals, the dyes have toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. The treatment of dyes can be done by various methods like membrane filtration, ion exchange, photochemical oxidation, nanotechnological approaches and various other physicochemical methods. Plants and microorganisms like algae, fungi, and bacteria also play a vital role in remediation of dyes through enzymatic processes. Phytoremediation of dyes takes place under the influence of reductase enzyme which reduces the dye into simpler organic compounds. Algae are source of carbon sink in oceans and also help in remediation of pollutants present in water. Algal cells are useful feedstock for various sectors of our economy such as biofuels, microalgal biochar, nutraceuticals, microbial fuel cell for bioelectricity, phyconanoparticles for environmental and medical applications. This review article aims to discuss dyes, sustainability issues and ecotoxicity related to them. It will give an insight on various methods of dye removal emphasising phytoremediation and factors responsible in its removal. The opportunities associated with the recovery of valuable products from algae would suggest it a sustainable approach in treatment of dyes present in effluents.","[Bhardwaj, Deepti; Bharadvaja, Navneeta] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Plant Biotechnol Lab, Delhi 110042, India",Delhi Technological University,"Bharadvaja, N (通讯作者)，Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Plant Biotechnol Lab, Delhi 110042, India.",navneetab@dce.ac.in,"Bharadvaja, Navneeta/KRP-8656-2024","bhardwaj, deepti/0000-0003-1165-5582",,,,,220,24,23,6,43,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

Experts warn that future pandemics may emerge more frequently with greater devastating effects on population health and the world economy. Although viruses are unable to propagate on lifeless surfaces, they can retain their infectivity and spread further on contact with these surfaces. The objective of our study is to analyze photoreactive composite films that exert antiviral effects upon illumination. Reactive plasmonic titanium dioxide-based polymeric nanocomposite film was prepared with a thickness of 1-1.5 mu m, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 435 nm). These species are suitable for photooxidation of adsorbed organic molecules (e.g., benzoic acid) on the nanocomposite surface. Moreover, high molecular weight proteins are also degraded or partially oxidized in this process on the composite surface. Since the Ag-0-TiO2/polymer composite film used showed excellent reactivity in the formation of OH center dot radicals, the photocatalytic effect on high molecular weight (M = similar to 66.000 Da) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein was investigated. Given that changes in the structure of the protein were observed upon exposure to light, we assumed virucidal effect of the illuminated photoreactive composite film. We tested this hypothesis using an airborne-transmitted herpesvirus. As a result, we obtained a drastic decrease in infection capability of the virus on the photoreactive surface compared to the control surface.","[Boldogkoi, Zsolt; Csabai, Zsolt; Tombacz, Dora; Duda, Erno] Univ Szeged, Fac Med, Dept Med Biol, Szeged, Hungary; [Janovak, Laszlo; Balassa, Lilla; Deak, Agota; Dekany, Imre] Univ Szeged, Dept Phys Chem & Mat Sci, Szeged, Hungary; [Toth, Peter S.; Janaky, Csaba] Univ Szeged, Interdisciplinary Excellence Ctr, Dept Phys Chem & Mat Sci, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University; Szeged University; Szeged University,"Boldogkoi, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Med, Dept Med Biol, Szeged, Hungary.;Dékány, I (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Dept Phys Chem & Mat Sci, Szeged, Hungary.",boldogkoi.zsolt@med.u-szeged.hu; i.dekany@chem.u-szeged.hu,"Janaky, Csaba/L-6467-2013; Janovak, Laszlo/C-1452-2016; Toth, Peter Sandor/ABB-1799-2021","Tombacz, Dora/0000-0001-5520-2978; Boldogkoi, Zsolt/0000-0003-1184-7293; Csabai, Zsolt/0000-0003-0031-0116","National Research, Development and Innovation Office [GINOP-2.3.2-15-201600013, GINOP-2.1.7-15-2016-01987]; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [UNKP-20-5, UNKP-20-4]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; OTKA [K 128247, FK 128252]; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-20-4-SZTE-148]; University of Szeged [5474]","National Research, Development and Innovation Office(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities; University of Szeged","This project was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (GINOP-2.3.2-15-201600013 and GINOP-2.1.7-15-2016-01987) to ID.

Large average reductions are recorded between the stations in each state such as PM10 (46 to 58%), PM2.5 (49 to 55%), NO2 (27 to 58%), NO (-54% to -59%), CO (-4 to -44%), NH3 (-2 to -38%), while a slight increase is observed for O-3 (+4 to +6%) during the lockdown period compared to same periods in previous years. Furthermore, PM and air pollutants are significantly reduced during lockdown compared to the respective period in previous years, while a significant increase in pollution levels is observed after the re-opening of economy. The meteorological changes were rather marginal between the examined periods in order to justify such large reductions in pollution levels, which are mostly attributed to traffic-related pollutants (NOx, CO and road-dust PM). The WRF-CHIMERE model simulations reveal a remarkable reduction in PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 levels over whole Indian subcontinent and mostly over urban areas, due to limitation in emissions from the traffic and industrial sectors. A PM2.5 reduction of -48% was simulated in Delhi in great consistency with measurements, rendering the model as a powerful tool for simulations of lower pollution levels during lockdown period.","[Dumka, U.

As of early 2024, grape growers in New York State have not reported spotted lanternfly-related issues. In contrast, growers in Pennsylvania experienced significant losses during the early years of infestation, with some vineyards replanting due to vine death caused by spotted lanternfly. Over time, Pennsylvania growers developed management strategies, but the threat remains significant. We hypothesize that New York grape growers, informed by the economic impacts faced by Pennsylvania growers, will adopt a risk-averse approach and will be better prepared to combat spotted lanternfly. This manuscript examines spotted lanternfly biology, life stages, and host plants while estimating potential economic impacts to inform growers, stakeholders, and policymakers about the potential economic losses in New York grape production. If left uncontrolled or if growers are uninformed and unprepared, economic losses in the Lake Erie and Finger Lakes regions could escalate significantly, reaching up to $1.5, $4, and $8.8 million in the first, second, and third years of infestation, respectively. These figures underscore the critical importance of proactive management and preparedness measures to mitigate the impact of spotted lanternfly infestations on agricultural economies. We also discuss the implication of these findings in management and regulatory efforts. Future research should focus on establishing the appropriate economic thresholds and conducting cost-benefit analyses of various pest control measures in grape production in New York.","[Pinto, Allan F.; Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Eshenaur, Brian C.; Calixto, Alejandro A.] Cornell Univ, New York State Integrated Pest Management Program, Geneva, NY USA; [Acevedo, Flor E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA USA; [Centinari, Michela] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Behrend; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Pinto, AF (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",afp68@cornell.edu,"Centinari, Michela/LTE-2849-2024; Acevedo, Flor/AAD-8780-2019","Acevedo, Flor E./0000-0002-0946-9951; Centinari, Michela/0000-0003-3798-5264; Pinto Padilla, Allan/0000-0002-1017-1589","Cornell New York State Integrated Pest Management Program; New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM); USDA SCRI CAP Proposal: Biology, Management, and Reducing the Impact of the Spotted Lanternfly in Specialty Crops in the Eastern USA [2019-51181-30014]","Cornell New York State Integrated Pest Management Program; New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM); USDA SCRI CAP Proposal: Biology, Management, and Reducing the Impact of the Spotted Lanternfly in Specialty Crops in the Eastern USA","Funding was provided by Cornell New York State Integrated Pest Management Program, the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM), and USDA SCRI CAP Proposal: Biology, Management, and Reducing the Impact of the Spotted Lanternfly in Specialty Crops in the Eastern USA Award Number: 2019-51181-30014.",,67,0,0,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,2155-7470,,J INTEGR PEST MANAG,J.

Design/methodology/approach- A bibliometric analysis was conducted, based on 434 articles retrieved from the Web of Science that represent the academic literature on the topic from 1995 to the first quarter of 2024. This paper analyses the antecedents of financial fraud exploiting the elderly, the publication trends and the most prolific countries, institutions, journals, research areas and authors. Bibliometric analyses based on co-citation and co-words explore the intellectual structure of the topic. A bibliographic coupling analysis reveals the hottest research trends in this field. Findings- A significant increase in the number of publications in recent years shows the importance gained by this research stream. The bibliometric analysis identifies four clusters throughout the literature: differentiation of types of elder abuse; protection of the elderly from fraud; cognitive and decision-making capacity in ageing; and factors influencing fraud victimization of the eldest. The most recent research lines identified through bibliographic coupling focused on the contextual and personal antecedents of financial exploitation of the elderly, as well as the possible impact of interventions. Several key research gaps and additional suggestions for further studies, as well as action lines for the financial authorities and economic agents, are outlined. Originality/value- This paper contributes to knowledge about financial fraud exploiting the elderly synthesizing the existing literature, stressing that the banking industry has to deal with such financial fraud in the context of a growing relevance of the silver economy.","[Lindez-Macarro, Maria-Elena; Gallego-Losada, Rocio; Montero-Navarro, Antonio; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose-Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresa, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Rodríguez-Sánchez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresa, Madrid, Spain.",elena.lindez@urjc.es; rocio.gallego@urjc.es; antonio.montero@urjc.es; joseluis.rodriguez.sanchez@urjc.es,"Montero-Navarro, Antonio/AAP-7895-2020; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose-Luis/N-6040-2018; Gallego-Losada, Rocio/Q-2094-2017","LINDEZ MACARRO, MARIA ELENA/0000-0002-6116-4792; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Jose-Luis/0000-0001-7913-8747; Gallego-Losada, Rocio/0000-0003-2470-6860",,,,,197,0,0,20,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0265-2323,1758-5937,,INT J BANK MARK,Int.

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are being made to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus, constituting the forefront of current global safety concerns and a significant burden on global economies. The development of innovative materials able to prevent the transmission, spread, and entry of COVID-19 pathogens into the human body is currently in the spotlight. The synthesis of these materials is, therefore, gaining momentum, as methods providing nontoxic and environmentally friendly procedures are in high demand. Here, a highly virucidal material constructed from SiO2-Ag composite immobilized in a polymeric matrix (ethyl vinyl acetate) is presented. The experimental results indicated that the as-fabricated samples exhibited high antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as well as towards SARS-CoV-2. Based on the present results and radical scavenger experiments, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the enhancement of the biocidal activity. In the presence of O-2 and H2O, the plasmon-assisted surface mechanism is the major reaction channel generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We believe that the present strategy based on the plasmonic effect would be a significant contribution to the design and preparation of efficient biocidal materials. This fundamental research is a precedent for the design and application of adequate technology to the next-generation of antiviral surfaces to combat SARS-CoV-2.","[Assis, Marcelo; Coelho, Dyovani; do Santos, Jeziel Rodrigues; Ribeiro, Lara Kelly; Viana Rosa, Ieda Lucia; Mascaro, Lucia Helena; Longo, Elson] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, LIEC, CDMF, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Assis, Marcelo; Andres, Juan] Univ Jaume I UJI, Dept Phys & Analyt Chem, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Simoes, Luiz Gustavo P.; Tremiliosi, Guilherme C.; Minozzi, Daniel T.; Santos, Renato, I; Vilela, Daiane C.

Objective: In this study, the antibacterial assessment of zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) against Streptococcus pyogenes and Acinetobacter baumannii has been performed. Methods: ZnS NPs were synthesized through a co-precipitation method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG-4000). The size and morphology of the synthesized ZnS NPs were determined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and it was found that the average size of the applied NPs was about 70 nm. In order to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the synthesized ZnS NPs, various concentrations (50 mu g/mL, 100 mu g/mL and 150 mu g/mL) of ZnS NPs were prepared. Antibacterial assessments were performed through the disc diffusion method in Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) culture medium and also the optical density (OD) method was performed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in Trypticase (TM) Soy Broth (TSB) medium. Then, in order to compare the antibacterial effects of the applied NPs, several commercial antibiotics including penicillin, amikacin, ceftazidime and primaxin were used. Results: The achieved results indicated that the antibacterial effects of ZnS NPs had a direct relation along with the concentrations and the concentration of 150 tg/mL showed the highest antibacterial effect in comparison with others. In addition, the ZnS NPs were more effective on Acinetobacter baumannii. Conclusion: The findings of this research suggest a novel approach against antibiotic resistance.","[Morshedtalab, Zeinab] Iran Food & Drug Adm, Tehran, Iran; [Rahimi, Ghasem] Agro Ind Complex Med Plants SPAD, Shiraz, Iran; [Emami-Nejad, Asieh; Ghaedamini, Nahid] Payame Noor Univ PNU, Dept Biol, POB 1995-697, Tehran, Iran; [Farasat, Alireza] Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Cellular & Mol Res Ctr, Res Inst Prevent Noncommunicable Dis, Qazvin, Iran; [Mohammadbeygi, Azita] Shahid Beheshti Int Univ, Dept Immunol, Tehran, Iran; [Negahdary, Masoud] Shahid Sadoughi Univ Med Sci, Yazd Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Yazd, Iran",Payame Noor University; Qazvin University of Medical Sciences (QUMS),"Negahdary, M (通讯作者)，Shahid Sadoughi Univ Med Sci, Yazd Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Yazd, Iran.",Masoudnegandary@ssu.ac.ir,"Negahdary, Masoud/AAC-8653-2019; Farasat, Alireza/AGO-3954-2022",,,,,,112,11,12,2,24,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1568-0266,1873-5294,,CURR TOP MED CHEM,Curr.

Food packaging continues to evolve along-with the innovations in material science and technology, as well as in light of consumer's demand. Presently, the modern consumers of competitive economies demands for food with natural quality, assured safety, minimal processing, extended shelf-life and ready-to-eat concept. Innovative packaging systems, not only ascertains transit preservation and effective distribution, but also facilitates communication at the consumer levels. The technological advances in the domain of food packaging in twenty-first century are mainly chaired by nanotechnology, the science of nano-materials. Nanotechnology manipulates and creates nanometer scale materials, of commercial and scientific relevance. Introduction of nanotechnology in food packaging sector has significantly addressed the food quality, safety and stability concerns. Besides, nanotechnology based packaging intimate's consumers about the real time quality of food product. Additionally, nanotechnology has been explored for controlled release of preservatives/antimicrobials, extending the product shelf life within the package. The promising reports for nanotechnology interventions in food packaging have established this as an independent priority research area. Nanoparticles based food packages offer improved barrier and mechanical properties, along with food preservation and have gained welcoming response from market and end users. In contrary, recent advances and up-liftment in this area have raised various ethical, environmental and safety concerns.

This study assesses how COVID-19 affects smallholder fish farmers and their response strategies by employing data collected from 250 fish farmers and traders from intensive fish-growing areas of Bangladesh. The results reveal that most farmers experienced difficulty obtaining inputs, and the price of those inputs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 period, resulting in several months of decreased production and operations. As a result of COVID-19, farm gate prices for silver carp, ruhu, common carp, grass carp, and tilapia fish dropped by 25%, 23%, 23%, 22%, 23%, and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, fish feed prices were found to increase significantly. Reduced income from fish farming and other sources has triggered a significant drop in capital for farming operations and production capacity improvement, leading to food insecurity. The most common coping strategies include reduced buying from the market (vegetables, fruits, meat, milk, etc.), relying on less expensive or less preferred food, purchasing food on credit, and selling assets. Notably, due to COVID-19, a new mode of marketing has evolved as an adaptation strategy in the fish marketing system, such as the use of the mobile phone (18%) and Facebook/internet to sell fish directly to the customer (16%). The sector requires short-term financial assistance to assist fish actors with production and marketing challenges.","[Alam, G. M.

This paper looks at the current research, along with the existing limitations, and suggests future areas where scientists can focus their efforts, in the field mycology. We show how fungi have become important emerging diseases in medical mycology. We discuss current trends and the potential of fungi in drug and novel compound discovery. We explore the current trends in phylogenomics, its potential, and outcomes and address the question of how phylogenomics can be applied in fungal ecology. In addition, the trends in functional genomics studies of fungi are discussed with their importance in unravelling the intricate mechanisms underlying fungal behaviour, interactions, and adaptations, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of fungal biology. We look at the current research in building materials, how they can be used as carbon sinks, and how fungi can be used in biocircular economies. The numbers of fungi have always been of great interest and have often been written about and estimates have varied greatly. Thus, we discuss current trends and future research needs in order to obtain more reliable estimates. We address the aspects of machine learning (AI) and how it can be used in mycological research. Plant pathogens are affecting food production systems on a global scale, and as such, we look at the current trends and future research needed in this area, particularly in disease detection. We look at the latest data from High Throughput Sequencing studies and question if we are still gaining new knowledge at the same rate as before. A review of current trends in nanotechnology is provided and its future potential is addressed. The importance of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi is addressed and future trends are acknowledged. Fungal databases are becoming more and more important, and we therefore provide a review of the current major databases. Edible and medicinal fungi have a huge potential as food and medicines, especially in Asia and their prospects are discussed. Lifestyle changes in fungi (e.g., from endophytes, to pathogens, and/or saprobes) are also extremely important and a current research trend and are therefore addressed in this special issue of Fungal Diversity.","[Hyde, Kevin D.; Gui, Heng; Hu, Yuwei; Mortimer, Peter E.; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka N.] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Hyde, Kevin D.; Gui, Heng; Hu, Yuwei; Mortimer, Peter E.; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka N.] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Yunnan Key Lab Wild Plant Resources, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Hyde, Kevin D.; de Farias, Antonio R.

Current researches on cloud resource allocation do not sufficiently address the issues of minimizing energy cost and maximizing revenue for various applications running in virtualized cloud data centers (VCDCs). This paper presents a new approach to optimize the profit of VCDC based on the service-level agreements (SLAs) between service providers and customers. A precise model of the external and internal request arrival rates is proposed for virtual machines at different service classes. An analytic probabilistic model is then developed for non-steady VCDC states. In addition, a smart controller is developed for fine-grained resource provisioning and sharing among multiple applications. Furthermore, a novel dynamic hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is developed for the formulated profit maximization problem, based on simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. The proposed algorithm can guarantee that differentiated service qualities can be provided with higher overall performance and lower energy cost. The advantage of the proposed approach is validated with trace-driven simulations. Note to Practitioners-Resource allocation plays an important role in constructing scalable and green VCDC. This work presents a novel and fundamental framework to achieve dynamic fine-grained resource allocation. It develops a dynamic fine-grained resource allocation model with non-steady states according to the external and internal workload of different resource-intensive applications in a VCDC. In order to meet the SLA requirements of Gold and Silver services for various applications while maximizing profit, this work proposes a dynamic hybrid optimization algorithm by combing particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a great potential to maximize the VCDC provider's profit. The proposed framework can aid the design and optimization of industrial cloud data centers and practitioners' understanding of SLA aspects of various applications.","[Bi, Jing; Li, Jianqiang] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Software Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Bi, Jing; Li, Jianqiang] Beijing Engn Res Ctr IoT Software & Syst, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Haitao] Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Tan, Wei] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Zhou, MengChu] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Fan, Yushun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jia] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Beijing University of Technology; Beihang University; International Business Machines (IBM); IBM USA; New Jersey Institute of Technology; Tsinghua University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Yuan, HT (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",bijing@bjut.edu.cn; cityu.yuan@gmail.com; wtan@us.ibm.com; zhou@njit.edu; fanyus@tsinghua.edu.cn; jia.zhang@sv.cmu.edu; lijianqiang@bjut.edu.cn,"Zhou, MengChu/H-9897-2014; Yuan, Haitao/LKO-1696-2024","Bi, Jing/0000-0002-4610-0141; Yuan, Haitao/0000-0002-1510-9127","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61033005, 61174169]; National Science and Technology Support Program of China [2012BAF15G01]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Support Program of China,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61033005 and 61174169, and in part by the National Science and Technology Support Program of China under Grant 2012BAF15G01.",,41,97,103,0,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-5955,1558-3783,,IEEE T AUTOM SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

Photocatalytic degradation is an effective method for resolving this problem at present. The method of combining plasmon resonance effect and Z -scheme heterojunction can effectively improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated carrier, which is of great significance for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater. Herein, the Ag/Ag 2 CrO 4 /g-C 3 N 4 catalyst was prepared by in -situ loading and photo -reduction method for the degradation of antibiotic wastewater containing tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics. The research results showed that mesoporous graphitized carbon nitride (denoted as g-C 3 N 4 ) provided good support for Ag and Ag 2 CrO 4 nanoparticles, and mesoporous composite Ag/Ag 2 CrO 4 /g-C 3 N 4 (denoted as ACO/CN) provided more reaction sites for organic pollutants degradation. Under visible light irradiation, 5%ACO/CN catalyst showed the best degradation activity and stability for tetracycline (TC), levofloxacin (LVFX), oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) and norfloxacin (NFLX), and their degradation rate constants were respectively 5.66, 8.26, 11.72 and 15.97 times of Ag 2 CrO 4 which indicated it had good potential application value in the treatment of wastewater containing various organic pollutants. This benefits from the plasmon resonance effect of silver effectively improves the utilization efficiency of visible light and the Z -scheme heterojunction between Ag 2 CrO 4 and g-C 3 N 4 promotes the rapid transmission of photogenerated carriers. Based on the experimental results, the possible TC degradation pathway and photocatalytic mechanism were proposed. This study provides a simple way for the successful design and preparation of plasmon resonance effect synergistic Z -scheme heterojunction with promising applications in the treatment of antibiotic wastewater.","[Du, Ying; Li, Juan; Ma, Xinqi; Guo, Quanhui] Henan Univ, Henan Engn Res Ctr Resource & Energy Recovery Wast, Sch Energy Sci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China",Henan University,"Li, J; Guo, QH (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Henan Engn Res Ctr Resource & Energy Recovery Wast, Sch Energy Sci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China.",lijuan@henu.edu.cn; qhguo@henu.edu.cn,,,Key Scientific and technological Project of Henan Province of China [202102310613]; Doctoral Research Foundation of Henan University of China [3050A0780473],Key Scientific and technological Project of Henan Province of China; Doctoral Research Foundation of Henan University of China,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by Key Scientific and technological Project of Henan Province of China (No. 202102310613) and Doctoral Research Foundation of Henan University of China (No. 3050A0780473) .,,58,3,3,9,20,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0042-207X,1879-2715,,VACUUM,Vacuum,AUG,2024,226,,,,,,,,113323,10.1016/j.vacuum.2024.113323,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vacuum.2024.113323,,MAY 2024,12,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Materials Science; Physics,UE4U8,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001246380500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These microorganisms inhabit plant tissues without causing disease or any noticeable symptoms. Endophytes effectively aid in eliminating contaminants from water systems. Nanoparticles serve as potent enhancers in bioremediation processes, augmenting the efficiency of pollutant degradation by increasing surface area and bioavailability, thereby improving the efficacy and rate of remediation. Their controlled nutrient release and ability to stabilize endophytic colonization further contribute to the enhanced and sustainable elimination of contaminated environments. The synergistic effect of endophytes and nanoparticles in water remediation has been widely explored in recent studies, revealing compelling outcomes. Water pollution poses significant threats to human health, ecosystems, and economies; hence, the sixth global goal of the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 of the United Nations aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water resources, recognizing their crucial importance for current and future generations. Conventional methods for addressing water pollution exhibit several limitations, including high costs, energy-intensive processes, the production of hazardous by-products, and insufficient effectiveness in mitigating emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics. Noticeably, there is an inability to effectively remove various types of pollutants, thus resulting in incomplete purification cycles. Nanoparticle-enhanced water bioremediation offers an innovative, eco-friendly alternative for degrading contaminants. A growing body of research has shown that integrating endophytic microorganisms with nanoparticles for water bioremediation is a potent and viable alternative. This review examines the potential of using endophytic microorganisms and nanoparticles to enhance water remediation, exploring their combined effects and applications in water purification. The paper also provides an overview of synthetic methods for producing endophyte-nanoparticle composites to optimize their remediation capabilities in aqueous environments. The final section of the review highlights the constraints related to integrating endophytes with nanoparticles.","[Manganyi, Madira Coutlyne] Sefako Makgatho Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 139, ZA-0204 Medunsa, South Africa; [Dikobe, Tshegofatso Bridget] North West Univ, Dept Bot, Unit Environm Sci & Management, Private Bag X2046, ZA-2735 Mmabatho, South Africa; [Maseme, Mametsi Rahab] Walter Sisulu Univ, Dept Chem & Phys Sci, Private Bag 11, ZA-5117 Mthatha, South Africa",Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University; North West University - South Africa; Walter Sisulu University,"Maseme, MR (通讯作者)，Walter Sisulu Univ, Dept Chem & Phys Sci, Private Bag 11, ZA-5117 Mthatha, South Africa.",mmaseme@wsu.ac.za,"Dikobe, Tshegofatso Bridget/AAC-1176-2022; MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/AAE-3590-2022","Dikobe, Tshegofatso Bridget/0000-0002-7857-3787; MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/0000-0002-0209-5547; Maseme, Mametsi Rahab/0000-0001-6108-9596",,,,,149,2,2,9,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,JUN,2024,29,12,,,,,,,2858,10.3390/molecules29122858,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules29122858,,,20,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,WP5X0,38930923,"Green Published, gold",,,2025-05-09,WOS:001256101500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the beginning, age management is defined in the context of the emerging challenges faced by today's organisations. One of the most important challenges for management is ageing and the development of an appropriate policy which would counter the negative consequences of managing age and make use of the positive attributes of elderly employees implemented as a coherent age management concept. The aim of this article is to present the differences and similarities in age management between Polish traditional and knowledge-based organisations. Thus, three dimensions of age management are presented: institutional, instrumental, and functional. The results of this study have been compared to other studies, thus shedding additional light on age management in Poland. Traditional and knowledge-based organisations obviously differ, and in our research, the biggest differences were found in their perception of elderly people and in the instrumental dimension of age management architecture. It can be expected that the development and growing popularity of age management will increasingly erase the remaining differences. It is probable that the differences in the institutional and functional spheres will disappear altogether, while the instrumental sphere of age management will remain differentiated. This differentiation is not about the use of an age management instrument as such, but about its characteristics, related to the degree of formalism, the scope of content, and the number of users. Traditional and knowledge-based organisations can also differentiate their accents in different spheres related to human resources management. It seems likely that this will occur in the near future, alongside changes which will dynamically implement those practices aimed at bringing equal and synergistic benefits to both elderly workers and employers.","[Warwas, Izabela] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Warwas, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,45,3,4,3,18,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Smart radiation devices (SRDs) are gaining attention as a low-cost, light-weight material for the thermal control of spacecraft. Previous works have focused on how to enhance IR emittance tunability of SRDs. In fact, the SRDs performance and lifetime may be affected by the external space environment. Thus, researchers proposed to cover the SRDs with a protective layer to resist oxidation and other problems. However, the influence of protective layer on the performance of SRDs, including IR emittance tunability Delta epsilon and solar absorption alpha s, has not been studied systematically yet. In this paper, the impact of protective layer on the performance of SRDs is comprehensively evaluated in theory. Firstly, a threelayer SRD is composed of a vanadium dioxide (VO2) film, BaF2, and a silver (Ag) substrate, which is optimized using the transfer matrix method. The IR emittance tunability and solar absorption can reach 0.64 and 0.29, respectively. Secondly, the smart thermal control device with three protection materials (BaF2, Al2O3 and Si) is investigated. The results show that the performance of SRD can be enhanced or deteriorated, depending on the types of protection materials and the thickness. When the protection material is Si, the IR emittance tunability can be enhanced to 0.65, while the solar absorption can be decreased to 0.18. The performance of the proposed SRD meets the requirement of the spacecraft thermal control devices.

Food quality currently creates significant problems for the industry and implicitly for consumers and society. The effects materialize in economic losses, alterations of the quality and organoleptic properties of the commercial products, and, last but not least, they constitute risk factors for the consumer's health. In this context, the development of analytical systems for the rapid determination of the sanitary quality of food products by detecting possible pathogenic microorganisms (such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella due to the important digestive disorders that they can cause in many consumers) is of major importance. Using efficient and environmentally friendly detection systems for identification of various pathogens that modify food matrices and turn them into food waste faster will also improve agri-food quality throughout the food chain. This paper reviews the use of metal nanoparticles used to obtain bio nanosensors for the purpose mentioned above. Metallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag, etc.) and their oxides can be synthesized by several methods, such as chemical, physical, physico-chemical, and biological, each bringing advantages and disadvantages in their use for developing nanosensors. In the green chemistry approach, a particular importance is given to the metal nanoparticles obtained by phytosynthesis. This method can lead to the development of good quality nanoparticles, at the same time being able to use secondary metabolites from vegetal wastes, as such providing a circular economy character. Considering these aspects, the use of phytosynthesized nanoparticles in other biosensing applications is also presented as a glimpse of their potential, which should be further explored.","[Ungureanu, Camelia; Tihan, Gratiela Teodora; Zgarian, Roxana Gabriela] Univ Politeh Bucharest, Dept Gen Chem, Bucharest 011061, Romania; [Fierascu, Irina; Baroi, Anda Maria; Fierascu, Radu Claudiu] Natl Inst Res Dev Chem & Petrochem ICECHIM, Bucharest 060021, Romania; [Fierascu, Irina; Baroi, Anda Maria] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Fac Hort, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Raileanu, Silviu] Univ Politeh Bucharest, Dept Automat & Ind Informat, Bucharest 011061, Romania; [Fierascu, Radu Claudiu] Univ Politeh Bucharest, Dept Sci & Engn Oxide Mat & Nanomat, Bucharest 011061, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; National Institute Research & Development in Chemistry & Petrochemistry; University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Tihan, GT; Zgârian, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Politeh Bucharest, Dept Gen Chem, Bucharest 011061, Romania.;Fierascu, RC (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Res Dev Chem & Petrochem ICECHIM, Bucharest 060021, Romania.;Fierascu, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Politeh Bucharest, Dept Sci & Engn Oxide Mat & Nanomat, Bucharest 011061, Romania.",gratiela.tihan@upb.ro; fierascu.radu@icechim.ro,"Fierascu, Radu/C-4280-2011; Zgarian, Roxana/C-5858-2011; Raileanu, Silviu/G-2566-2016; UNGUREANU, Camelia/HKW-0155-2023; TIHAN, GRATIELA/AAT-5860-2020; Fierascu, Irina/C-4284-2011","Fierascu, Irina/0000-0002-1834-9812","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI III [PN-III-P2-2.1-PED-2021-0042]; Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization [15PFE/2021]","Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI III; Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization","This work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P2-2.1-PED-2021-0042, within PNCDI III.

Therefore, the present work's objective is to perform a life cycle analysis of the leaching process of valuable metals extracted from these wastes for the ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methyl-imida-zolium hydrogen sulfate (Bmim HSO4), 1-methylimidazolinium hydrogen sulfate (Hmim HSO4), 1-butyl-3-meth-ylimidazolium bromide (Bmim Br), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (Bmim Cl), using a cradle-to-gate  life cycle analysis approach. For the leaching inventory, a 60% ionic liquid concentration at 60 C was considered, based on previous studies where high copper and cobalt extractions are achieved by using Bmim HSO4 and Hmim HSO4, on the other hand, high silver and gold extractions are achieved with Bmim Br and Bmim Cl. When performing the impact analysis, it was observed that ionic liquids have a high impact which is attributed to glyoxal, 1-methylimidazole, and finally sulfuric acid. As this impact was considerable, a sensitivity analysis with two options was considered, decreasing the ionic liquid concentration from 60% to 20% at the same temperature of 60 C. The other option is an assumption of recovering 90% of the ionic liquid from the leaching solution. In both options, the decrease in impact related to the main analysis is very considerable. This opens research possibilities on the IL recovery, which is a very tentative option, it is emphasized that the recovery effect can increase or decrease the impact depending on the type of separation process that is used.","[Vallejos-Michea, Camila; Barrueto, Yahaira; Jimenez, Yecid P.] Univ Antofagasta, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Quim & Proc Minerales, Av Angamos 601, Antofagasta, Chile; [Jimenez, Yecid P.] Univ Antofagasta, Fac Ingn, Ctr Econ Circular Proc Ind CECPI, Av Angamos 601, Antofagasta, Chile",Universidad de Antofagasta; Universidad de Antofagasta,"Jimenez, YP (通讯作者)，Univ Antofagasta, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Quim & Proc Minerales, Av Angamos 601, Antofagasta, Chile.",yecid.jimenez@uantof.cl,"Barrueto, Yahaira/GQI-3494-2022","Jimenez Bellott, Yecid Ponciano/0000-0001-6451-4615",Project ING2030,Project ING2030,The authors thank to the Project ING2030 CORFO Code 16ENI2-71940.,,41,7,7,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Considering these factors, it is important to monitor these metals at each stage of treatment used to recover the valuable metals. In the present work, the behavior of As and Pb was assessed during the pretreatment conducted on a jarositic residue using direct zinc leaching (DLR), as well as leaching in cyanide and cyanide media with glycine. It was found that when no DLR pretreatment was performed, As and Pb naturally dissolved in the cyanide-leaching medium at concentrations of 34.08 mg/L and 99.12 mg/L, respectively. When an alkaline treatment was conducted on the residue (DLR-AH), it was found that there was no presence of As and Pb in the cyanidation solution, while in the case of the cyanide solution with glycine, we observed 83.35 mg/L of As and 213.63 mg/L of Pb. During the oxidizing alkaline hydrothermal treatment (DLR-AHO), 27.5 mg/L of As and 106.78 mg/L of Pb were detected in the cyanide solution. In the cyanide solution with glycine, there was less dissolution of As and Pb (11.68 and 66.75 mg/L), respectively. Finally, when desulfurization of the DLR was conducted prior to the DLR-AHO treatment, the dissolution of As and Pb increased due to the elemental sulfur covering the arsenopyrite and galena particles, so that, when removed, these were more susceptible to pretreatment and cyanidation.","[Picazo-Rodriguez, Nallely G.] Tecnol Nacl Mexico, Inst Tecnol Super Monclova, Monclova 25701, Mexico; [Soria-Aguilar, Ma. de Jesus; Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Fac Met, Monclova 25710, Mexico; [Chaidez, Josue; Flores, Manuel] Penoles Tecnol, Torreon 27268, Mexico; [Almaguer-Guzman, Isaias] Met Met Mex Penoles, Torreon 27370, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila,"Picazo-Rodríguez, NG (通讯作者)，Tecnol Nacl Mexico, Inst Tecnol Super Monclova, Monclova 25701, Mexico.;Carrillo-Pedroza, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Fac Met, Monclova 25710, Mexico.",nallely.pr@monclova.tecnm.mx; raul.carrillo@uadec.edu.mx,"Flores, Manuel/Y-2651-2019; Picazo, Nallely/AAF-4773-2020; Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul/A-8130-2019","Chaidez Felix, Josue Carlo/0000-0001-8200-4539; Soria Aguilar, Ma. de Jesus/0000-0003-3910-7772; Carrillo-Pedroza, Francisco Raul/0000-0002-0413-0676",CONACYT scholarship,CONACYT scholarship(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The Research and Development Center (CIDT-SEPSA) Penoles supplied the samples, chemical analysis, DRX, and SEM characterization.

Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual end-points with emphasis on ENM risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine ENM benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of ENM SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the SEE system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable ENMs in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature. Rather, it is a position paper that largely expresses the views of the authors based on their expert opinion drawn from industrial and academic experience.

For that purpose, the jute fabrics were characterized in terms of their chemical composition, structural parameters, mechanical properties, volume electrical resistivity, antibacterial activity and biosorption of Zn2+. Moreover, the jute fabrics were functionalized by incorporation of silver ions and the fabrics were evaluated as sorption material with a further perspective of reuse. After the alkali modifications, the hemicelluloses were selectively removed and the fabric structural parameters increased. Alkali modifications under mild conditions (1% NaOH for 30 min and 5% NaOH for 5 min) lead to a decrease, while the most intensive alkali modification (17.5% NaOH for 30 min) contributed to an increase in the volume electrical resistivity and fabric maximum force compared to unmodified fabric. A relationship between the jute fabric chemical composition, crystallinity index, conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II, fabric structural parameters and volume electrical resistivity was found. The oxidations lead to selective lignin removal, which consequently causes a decrease in the volume electrical resistivity and fabric maximum force. Ag(+)incorporated in the selected samples decreased their electrical resistivity even further. Following the increased focus on the concept of circular economy and sustainable development goals, the biosorption potential of damaged and waste jute fabrics for Zn(2+)was investigated. Jute fabrics with incorporated Ag(+)and those obtained after the biosorption of Zn(2+)provided maximum bacterial reduction (99.99%) forEscherichia coliandStaphylococcus aureus. The chemically modified jute fabrics can be utilized as carpet backing and protective clothing in environments sensitive to electrical discharges, but also as filters for water disinfection and biosorbents for Zn2+.

The purpose is to increase legibility as well as technical and financial access to innovations for vulnerable seniors who are remote from the digital era, through a multiservice user-friendly platform. Launched at the end of 2015, the project rallies over 10 actors of the silver economy currently developing personalised ICT tools to improve the safety and comfort of seniors and the coordination between health and social care. The objective is threefold: i) developing new adapted technologies, ii) having them evaluated by retirees and professionals and iii) making them accessible to the ICT web platform which will provide tutorials and prices and collect opinions from users and professionals. 500 retirees selected by CARSAT-LR will be testing these new devices and solutions which will be provided without charge. The following will be evaluated: i) feedback from users; ii) benefits gained through accessing comprehensive and appropriate information; iii) coordination of caregivers and professionals; iv) enjoyment from using the products (access to games, social links, customer confidence, sense of safety). This is a unique opportunity to mobilise solutions in a structured manner, bringing together competing businesses under a consortium agreement. Advantages for these businesses include acceleration of development and availability of their adapted solutions as well as the possibility to test their products on a significant panel of people.

Massachusetts Bay and the Viceroyalty of Peru provide a useful study in contrasts, having markedly different institutions and resource endowments. Both colonies originally emphasised the provision of << good >> money, that is, the provision of a uniform coin (in weight and fineness) and of a sensible mix of large and small denomination coins that would support the domestic economy. Their outcomes, however, differed. We suggest that in Potosi, the sheer volume of the resource endowment (silver) incentivised fraud and the neglect of the provision of fractionary coinage in the viceroyalty. In contrast, in Massachusetts Bay, the scarcity of the resource produced incentives better aligned with the production of << good >> money. The northern colony produced a trustworthy coinage that provided small denomination coins for the domestic market. Este articulo contribuye a la literatura sobre la gestion de politicas monetarias en la Edad Moderna. El contraste del caso del virreinato peruano con el de Massachusetts Bay es de particular utilidad para ilustrar este tema, dados sus enormes contrastes en la disponibilidad del recurso natural. Las dos colonias originalmente enfatizaron el interes publico: la produccion de una moneda confiable, compuesta por altas y bajas denominaciones, que satisficiera al mercado domestico. Sin embargo, sus resultados fueron marcadamente diferentes. En Potosi, la abundancia de la plata, y la consecuente enorme escala de las operaciones de la fabrica de monedas, incentivaron el fraude y la produccion de monedas de alta denominacion, lo que llevo al descuido del mercado interno. En el caso de Massachusetts Bay, la escasez de la plata genero incentivos mejor alineados con la produccion de una moneda confiable que respondiera de manera mas efectiva a las demandas del publico.","[Knodell, Jane E.; Vizcarra, Catalina M.] Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Knodell, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",jane.knodell@uvm.edu; catalina.vizcarra@uvm.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,2,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

As the world faces the dangerous effects of global warming, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has become a critical priority for governments, corporations and individuals around the world. Carbon markets offer a way to incentivize and encourage emissions reductions and facilitate a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Low-carbon development is possible by building transparent and understandable organizational and economic conditions for the operation of carbon regulation. This article considers the feasibility of introducing energy-efficient technologies at Polymetal International PLC enterprises located in Khabarovsk region, engaged in the mining and processing of non-ferrous and precious metals (gold, silver and copper) in light of the country's growing attention to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions. The objective of this study is to model the organizational and economic conditions of the carbon market and estimate the economic and climate outcomes from the implementation of energy-efficient technologies at Polymetal International PLC. This study analyzes the current energy-consumption structure of non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises in Russia and identifies potential areas for the use of energy-efficient technologies. An important aspect is the assessment of government policies and incentives that could facilitate the introduction of low-carbon technologies. It is important to assess the impact of prospective carbon-management plans in Russia on the economic performance of steel companies. The results of this study suggest that the introduction of low-carbon technologies has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, lower operating costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from non-ferrous metal companies in Russia. However, the successful implementation of these technologies will require significant investment, stakeholder cooperation and political support from the Russian government.","[Cherepovitsyn, Alexey; Stroykov, Gennady] St Petersburg Min Univ, Org & Management Dept, 21 Line,2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia; [Nevolin, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Luzin Inst Econ Studies, Kola Sci Ctr, 24a Fersmana St, Apatity 184209, Russia","Saint Petersburg Mining University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Luzin Institute for Economic Studies, Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Stroykov, G (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Min Univ, Org & Management Dept, 21 Line,2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia.",alekseicherepov@inbox.ru; g.a.stroykov@mail.ru; aprec99@mail.ru,"Stroykov, Gennadiy/AAG-7989-2021; Cherepovitsyn, Aleksei/S-4875-2017","Cherepovitsyn, Alexey/0000-0003-0472-026X; Stroikov, Gennadii/0000-0001-6250-8166",,,,,60,4,4,12,33,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2023,15,24,,,,,,,16640,10.3390/su152416640,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152416640,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DG9S7,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:001131000300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For over a century, agro-chemicals have been used for plant disease management; however, the excessive use of agrochemicals poses a threat to the environment and human health. Nanomaterials have been investigated in various agricultural applications, such as stress tolerance, seed germination, plant disease control, and plant growth enhancement. Nonetheless, the prevalent chemical and physical methods used for nanomaterial synthesis are uneconomical and involve hazardous reagents, which limit their widespread application in agriculture. Biogenic synthesis of nanomaterials provides natural reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents, making it cost-effective, environ-mentally friendly, and highly efficient. With the advances in nanobiotechnology, biogenic nanomaterials can substitute agrochemicals and traditional nanoparticles for plant disease management, enabling the development of sustainable agriculture. This review provides an assessment of the recent advances in the diverse roles of biogenic NMs for controlling phytopathogens. In the first part of this review, the benefits and drawbacks of using traditional agrochemicals are highlighted. The next sections critically discuss the use of biogenic nanomaterials for the control of phytopathogens, with a special emphasis on controlling fungal, bacterial, and viral phyto-pathogens. The pros and cons of the biogenic synthesis of nanomaterials for phytopathogen control are eluci-dated. The ecological safety and challenging gaps of using biogenic nanomaterials for sustainable agriculture are discussed, highlighting the fate of biogenic nanomaterials in soil-plant ecosystem, with an evaluation of the potential threats to the soil ecosystem. Prospects to overcome the current limitations of biosynthesis and po-tential applications of biogenic nanomaterials for plant disease control are proposed to achieve sustainable agriculture. The biocidal potential of biogenic nanomaterials can be utilized as biological nano weapons for plant disease control, providing an insightful perspective for future generations.","[Omran, Basma A.; Baek, Kwang-Hyun] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea; [Omran, Basma A.] Egyptian Petr Res Inst, Dept Proc Design & Dev, Cairo PO, Nasr City 11727, Egypt",Yeungnam University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute (EPRI),"Baek, KH (通讯作者)，Yeungnam Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Gyongsan 38541, South Korea.",khbaek@ynu.ac.kr,"Omran, Basma/JJE-7493-2023","Omran, Basma/0000-0002-3934-9088",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2021R1F1A1060297],"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea)","Funding This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) , funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2021R1F1A1060297) .",,283,28,30,9,68,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Their prevalence is due to their portability, rapid time-to-result, simplicity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. LFAs are well-suited for early detection of infectious diseases, which threatens public health and the economy, enabling timely medical intervention, and management of disease and treatment. This is vital for rural and resource-limited settings where well-equipped laboratories with well-trained personnel are scarce. Nevertheless, LFAs have certain limitations, such as moderate sensitivity and target throughput, as compared to lab-based technologies. Also, the development of LFA, although well-defined, is not straightforward. In this review article, we will elucidate the iterative process of LFA development, and discuss strategies for generating sensitive and specific capture/detector agents, multiplexed detection and signal amplification. An important starting point in LFA development is the clear definition/identification of design inputs and predicate. Newly engineered capture/detector agents, such as nanobodies and aptamers, should possess high binding affinity and functionality in body fluid samples for practical field application. Also, chemical methods, combined with engineering, have enabled multiplexing and signal amplification capabilities for higher target throughput and detection sensitivity. Furthermore, LFAs can be augmented or adapted to other platforms, such as smartphone, spectroscopy and electrochemistry, for quantitative measurements that can engender wider applications and adoption. Through these advances, LFA will transform into a genuinely versatile platform, capable of delivering accurate results that are similar to lab-based technologies, while retaining its advantage as a simple, portable, inexpensive and rapid test.

The project had two primary aims: firstly, to attempt to value economically the health cost-benefits associated with the quality of urban environments and, secondly, to interview those in control of urban development in the UK in order to reveal the potential barriers to, and opportunities for, the creation of healthy urban environments, including their views on the use of economic valuation of (planetary) health outcomes. Much is known about the 'downstream' impact of urban environments on human and planetary health and about how to design and plan healthy towns and cities ('midstream'), but we understand relatively little about how health can be factored in at key governance tipping points further 'upstream', particularly within dominant private sector areas of control (e.g. land, finance, delivery) at sub-national level. Our findings suggest that both public and private sector appeared well aware of the major health challenges posed by poor-quality urban environments. Yet they also recognized that health is not factored adequately into the urban planning process, and there was considerable support for greater use of non-market economic valuation to help improve decision-making. There was no silver bullet however: 110 barriers and 76 opportunities were identified across a highly complex range of systems, actors and processes, including many possible points of targeted intervention for economic valuation. Eight main themes were identified as key areas for discussion and future focus. This findings paper is the second of two on this phase of the project: the first sets out the rationale, approach and methodological lessons learned.","[Black, Daniel] Univ Bristol, Daniel Black Associates, Db A, Bristol, Avon, England; [Pilkington, Paul; Williams, Ben; Ige, Janet] UWE Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Prestwood, Emily] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Hunt, Alistair; Eaton, Eleanor] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Scally, Gabriel] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Scally, Gabriel] Gabriel Scally Publ Hlth Associates, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of West England; University of Birmingham; University of Bath; University of Bristol,"Ige, J (通讯作者)，UWE Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.",Daniel.Black@bristol.ac.uk; Janet.Ige@uwe.ac.uk,,"Hunt, Alistair/0000-0003-1437-2289; Black, Daniel/0000-0002-1474-6992; Eaton, Eleanor/0000-0002-9586-1019",UK Prevention Research Partnership; British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; Health and Social Care Research and Development Division (Welsh Government); Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research; Natural Environment Research Council; Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland); Health Foundation; Wellcome Trust; MRC [MR/S037586/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Prevention Research Partnership; British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Health and Social Care Research and Development Division (Welsh Government); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland); Health Foundation; Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"All authors contributed substantially to this paper.

Coronavirus disease 2019 known as COVID-19 is the worst pandemic since World War II. The outbreak of COVID-19 had a significant repercussion on the health, economy, politics, and environment, making coronavirus-related issues more complicated and becoming one of the most challenging pandemics of the last century with deadly outcomes and a high rate of the reproduction number. There are thousands of different types - or variants - of COVID circulating across the world. Viruses mutate all the time; it emphasizes the critical need for the designing of efficient vaccines to prevent virus infection, early and fast diagnosis, and effective antiviral and protective therapeutics. In this regard, the use of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for the development of novel strategies in terms of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. This review presents an outline of the platforms developed using plasmonic nanoparticles in the detection, treatment, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. We select the best strategies in each of these approaches. The properties of metallic plasmon NPs and their relevance in the development of novel point-of-care diagnosis approaches for COVID-19 are highlighted. Also, we discuss the current challenges and the future perspectives looking towards the clinical translation and the commercial aspects of nanotechnology and plasmonic NP-based diagnostic tools and therapy to fight COVID-19 pandemic.

The investigations aimed to characterize, evaluate, categorize and classify the development status of the recovery projects in the Canton of Zurich, including two technology pathways, i.e. dry and wet bottom-ash recovery. The temporal scale commenced with the exploration phase in 2003 and concluded with two technological pathways, both operating commercial projects in 2017. A retrospective view allowed the identification of enablers and barriers that affected the development status of the recovery projects. Further the recovery perspective allowed the results to be communicated to the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC). The investigation showed two main trends. Firstly, the development status of the recovery projects from exploration to commercial project phase was mainly driven by the knowledge increase regarding sampling and metal characterization in bottom-ash, the readiness and effectiveness of the recovery technologies and the changes of the legal and financial environment. Secondly, the amount of recovered material (dry matter content) increased from about 6900 tons in 2003 to 16,500 tons in 2017, which is congruent with an increase in the recovery rate from 5 to 14 percent per weight. In particular, the amount of elements recoverable with an economic and environmental benefit, such as copper, gold and silver, increased. Correspondingly, the residual particular metal content in the disposable bottom-ash (fraction 2-16 mm) decreased to < 1 percent per weight dry matter and therefore reduced the risk for environmental at the sanitary landfills. The findings provide 'lessons learned' for companies, authorities and investors who intend to develop material recovery projects. Even though the recovery potentials depend on site-specific conditions, the UNFC allows comparing individual recovery projects under different boundary conditions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

If the energy required to drive catalytic processes could be harvested directly from sunlight, the possibility of replacing contemporary processes based on terrestrial fuels by the conversion of light into chemical energy could become a step closer to reality. Plasmonic catalysis is currently at the forefront of photocatalysis, enabling one to overcome the limitations of classical wide bandgap semiconductors for solar-driven chemistry. Plasmonic catalysis enables the acceleration and control of a variety of molecular transformations due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation. Studies in this area have often focused on the fundamental understanding of plasmonic catalysis and the demonstration of plasmonic catalytic activities towards different reactions. In this feature article, we discuss recent contributions from our group in this field by employing plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable features as model systems to gain insights into structure-performance relationships in plasmonic catalysis. We start by discussing the effect of size, shape, and composition in plasmonic NPs over their activities towards LSPR-mediated molecular transformations. Then, we focus on the effect of metal support interactions over activities, reaction selectivity, and reaction pathways. Next, we shift to the control over the structure in hollow NPs and nanorattles. Inspired by the findings from these model systems, we demonstrate a design-driven strategy for the development of plasmonic catalysts based on plasmonic-catalytic multicomponent NPs for two types of molecular transformations: the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and the oxygen evolution reaction. Finally, future directions, challenges, and perspectives in the field of plasmonic catalysis with designer NPs are discussed. We believe that the examples and concepts presented herein may inspire work and progress in plasmonic catalysis encompassing the design of plasmonic multicomponent materials, new strategies to control reaction selectivity, and the unraveling of stability and reaction mechanisms.","[da Silva, Anderson G.

This recycling approach has its disadvantages, e.g. excessive energy consumption and dust emission causing loss of valuable metals. To fulfil the concept of Zero Waste for WSCWs, the authors present a sustainable technology for liberation of valuable metals from WSCWs and synthesis of added value products, in particular Ag nanoparticles and Al microparticles. The suggested technology consisted of three different approaches combined to liberate each material individually. The technology started with an Al layer disintegration process using Dimethyl Sulfoxide (as an eco-friendly and sustainable solvent) supported by ultrasonic treatment to break van der Waals' bonding between spherical Al microparticles that compose the Al paste layer, thus liberating Al in microparticle suspension form with particle size similar to 3 mu m, recovery rate >98%. After that, leaching by nitric acid and other eco-friendly reagents (Sodium Chloride, Ammonia solution and glucose syrup) assisted by ultrasonic treatment was used to dissolve Ag and later precipitate it in form of nanoparticles with avg. size 30 nm, yield >92%. Finally, etching using paste containing phosphoric acid was done to remove anti-reflection coating and purify the Si substrate with final recovery rate >99%. SEM-EDS, XRD, FTIR, and TEM were used for analysis of extracted materials as well as changes in the solvent. Investigation was also concerned with determining economic/global warming impacts of the technology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we combine macro-charcoal records from charcoal production sites (kiln sites) with such from archaeological sites to elucidate past forest composition and its dependency on past fuel economy and human resource management. The anthracological investigations of seven medieval smelting sites in the Harz Mountains provide detailed information about past fuel and woodland usage. First, the charcoal records allow for separation of chronological phases within the archaeological sites. Second, a selection of distinct wood species is identified for the different smelting activities (silver-copper-production). Third, in addition to reconstructing the human activities related to ore smelting, it remains possible to reconstruct the local vegetation in the surroundings of the former smelting sites. The new anthracological investigations of kiln sites in the Harz Mountains focus on higher elevations (>600 mNN) and date to (early) modern times, showing a temporal and spatial shift of woodland exploitation to more remote, higher elevated areas. As expected, all typical taxa of the natural montane woodlands were used. Thus, local topographical conditions and natural woodland composition mainly regulate wood usage rather than human selection. Picea abies is the dominant species in all the records. However, surprisingly, local scale expansion of the montane beech woodland (Calamagrostio villosae-Fagetum) was identified, which reaches areas that today are fully covered by spruce woodland. Thus, the new results contradict the previously accepted assumption that the Harz Mountains above 750 mNN were covered by pure, natural stands of spruce until the 17th century. A recommendation for the woodland conservancy concept of the Harz national park, which includes tree planting to push woodland renaturalization is to add the planting of Fagus and Acer in elevations above 600 m.

A stringent recycling effort to recover metal resources from end-of-life PVs is required for resource recovery, circular economy, and subsequent reduction of environmental impact. The recovery of metallic resources (silicon, silver, copper, lead, and tin) from the first-generation PVs and critical elements (tellurium, indium, selenium, and gallium) from second-generation PVs are mainly targeted. This review systematically discusses the recycling literature of both generations of solar cells, market value calculations, recycling preferences, global trends, and the Indian perspective. The status of PV module recycling on a commercial scale and academic research efforts are discussed. The review systematically discusses the various possible pretreatments and extraction/refining processes. The pretreatments (physical, chemical, thermal, and hybrid processes) play a decisive role in up- gradation, impurity removal, and metal recovery. The challenges include homogeneous collection, process efficiency, holistic resource recovery, and energy considerations. Toxicity characteristics of both generations, life cycle assessment studies, recycling challenges with proposed flowsheets, and a detailed future outlook are propounded to develop a holistic metal recovery approach. In comparison, crystalline Si PVs comprise the maximum economic value. One tonne of mixed PVs (first and second generation) can yield similar to 9.32 kg of Cu, similar to 0.30 kg of Ag, similar to 33.48 kg of Si, similar to 1.12 kg of Sn, similar to 1.12 kg of Pb, similar to 4.9 g of Cd, similar to 2.5 g of Te, and similar to 3.4 g of In.","[Gahlot, Rohit; Mir, Shaila; Dhawan, Nikhil] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Mat Recycling Lab, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Dhawan, N (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Mat Recycling Lab, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",dhawan.nikhil@gmail.com,,"DHAWAN, NIKHIL/0000-0002-0404-4575","Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India [FIG-100714]","Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India","This work was supported by a Faculty Initiation grant (FIG-100714) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India.",,152,18,19,17,128,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0887-0624,1520-5029,,ENERG FUEL,Energy Fuels,DEC 15,2022,36,24,,,,,14554,14572,,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c02847,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c02847,,DEC 2022,19,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,7B8NM,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000892816700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the EU (including the new member states) hospital overcapacity is a serious problem, from a technical, fiscal and political perspective. Few countries have succeeded in establishing an appropriate framework for resource management and for guaranteeing long-term financial viability of their hospital network. Many countries are in search of effective policies for improved hospital management and more cost-effective resource use in the health sector. Over the past decade, experiences in Austria and Estonia have emerged as innovative examples which may provide lessons for other EU countries and beyond. This paper describes the evolution of public hospitals from public budgetary units and public management to incorporated autonomous organizations under private corporate law, resulting in a contractual relationship between (public) owners and private hospital management. Outdated and inefficient public sector structures were replaced by more agile corporate management. The arrangement allows for investments, operating costs and budgeting according to strategic business goals as opposed to political fiat. Shielding hospitals from local political influence is an important aspect of this concept. Horizontal integration through networking of public hospitals and introducing private management helps create a new corporate culture, allowing for more flexibility to achieve efficiencies through downsizing and economies of scale. Based on contracts the new balance between ownership and managerial functions create strong incentives for a more business-like, results-oriented and consumer-friendly management. This was achieved both in Austria and Estonia in a politically sensitive way, adopting a long-term vision and by protecting the interests of hospital owners and staff. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Additional anti-herbivore functions of trichomes, especially in coastal and desert habitats, are reviewed and proposed. Many sand-dune and sandy shore plants are white, whitish, or silver-colored because of white trichomes, because of sticky glandular trichomes to which sand grains and clay adhere, or because of light-colored waxes. The common explanation for this coloration is that it protects from irradiation, and that in addition, the glued sand defends them from abrasion by moving sand. This coloration was also proposed to camouflage the plants from herbivores. Similar coloration in animals that live in white, snow-covered habitats or light-colored sand or other soil substrates is commonly referred to as camouflage, and the same logic may also apply to plants. It has also been proposed that white plant surfaces undermine the camouflage of herbivorous insects that have other colors and expose them to predation. Three novel defensive mechanisms are proposed here: (I) because dust is a strong insect repellent and is lethal to insects, attached soil particles (especially clays) may defend plants with sticky glandular trichomes from insect herbivory; (2) in dicotyledonous plants that have sticky glandular trichomes, the attached sand may defend from herbivory by mammals by causing teeth wear as do phytoliths (silica bodies) of grasses; and (3) white coloration of leaves and branches may mimic fungal infestation. Direct experimental data for the functionality of these defensive mechanisms are missing for many of the old and all new hypotheses, but there are many indirect supporting indications.","Univ Haifa, Fac Sci & Sci Educ, Dept Biol, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel",University of Haifa,"Lev-Yadun, S (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Fac Sci & Sci Educ, Dept Biol, IL-36006 Tivon, Israel.",levyadun@research.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,,125,42,48,0,64,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0792-9978,2223-8980,,ISR J PLANT SCI,Isr.

Progression in nanotechnology and its impacts have brought up concerns about the application of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in various sectors of the economy, including the field of agronomy. Among various NPs, there has been a rising amount of interest regarding the effects of titanium NPs (TiNPs) on plants growth and development, and their fate of abiotic stress tolerance. Hence, the present study was aimed to assess the ameliorative potentialities of chemically and biologically/green synthesized TiNPs to alleviate As-induced toxic responses in Vigna radiata L. The results revealed that exposure to As hindered the growth indices (radicle length and biomass) and membrane integrity, while were improved with the application of chemical and green synthesized TiNPs. In addition, treatment of As provoked the accretion of reactive oxygen species (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and malondialdehyde (a lipid peroxidized product), but were diminished by the supplementation of chemical and green manufactured TiNPs. The experimental data also signified that exogenous application of chemical and green synthesized TiNPs conferred tolerance to As-induced oxidative injuries via perking-up the expressions of antioxidant genes and enzyme systems viz; superoxide dismutase and catalase. Therefore, the present study inferred that chemically and green synthesized TiNPs, particularly green manufactured, effectively mitigated the adverse impacts of As by augmenting antioxidant machinery, thereby proving its potentiality in the alleviation of As-toxicity, at least in Vignaradiata L.

Although significant progress has been made in the control and therapy of mastitis, the frequency of this disease continues to be high in livestock herds, having a negative influence on productive parameters and implicitly on economic indices in dairy farms. The opportunity to address this problem resides in the fact that a countries' share of the community market will only be maintained by increasing milk quality. It is imperative for cattle farmers, milk producers and national economies to obtain milk according to EU standards, in order for it to be valued at advantageous, competitive prices. This objective may be achieved by keeping the incidence of mastitis under very strict control, using novel treatment options. Nanomaterials have been used for diagnosis and therapy in the human medical field, while their application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively new. Nanotechnology, however, is a rapidly growing field, offering the possibility of manufacturing new materials at the nanoscale level, with the formidable potential to revolutionize the agri-food sector by offering novel treatment options for prevalent and expensive illnesses such as bovine mastitis. Since current treatments are becoming progressively more ineffective in resistant bacteria, the development of innovative products based on both nanotechnology and phytotherapy may directly address a major global problem, antimicrobial resistance, while providing a sustainable animal health solution that supports the production of safe and high-quality food products. This review summarizes the challenges encountered presently in the treatment of bovine mastitis, emphasizing the possibility of using new-generation nanomaterials (e.g., biological synthesized nanoparticles and graphene) and essential oils, as candidates for developing novel treatment options for bovine mastitis.","[Neculai-Valeanu, Andra Sabina; Ariton, Adina Mirela; Madescu, Bianca Maria] Res & Dev Stn Cattle Breeding Dancu, Sos Iasi Ungheni 9, Dancu 707252, Romania; [Ariton, Adina Mirela; Madescu, Bianca Maria; Creanga, Steofil] Iasi Univ Life Sci IULS, Fac Food & Anim Sci, Dept Fundamental Sci Anim Husb, Mihail Sadoveanu Alley 8, Iasi 700490, Romania; [Rimbu, Cristina Mihaela] Iasi Univ Life Sci IULS, Fac Vet Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Mihail Sadoveanu Alley 8, Iasi 700490, Romania","Iasi University of Life Sciences, Romania","Neculai-Valeanu, AS (通讯作者)，Res & Dev Stn Cattle Breeding Dancu, Sos Iasi Ungheni 9, Dancu 707252, Romania.",sabina.valeanu@scdb-dancu.ro; mirela.ariton@scdb-dancu.ro; biancamadescu@uaiasi.ro; crimbu@uaiasi.ro; screanga@uaiasi.ro,"VALEANU, ANDRA SABINA/AAB-4852-2022; Creanga, Steofil/KEI-8984-2024; RÎMBU, CRISTINA/AAP-7898-2020; Madescu, Bianca/KEI-3761-2024; Ariton, Adina Mirela/AGG-5110-2022","MADESCU, BIANCA MARIA/0000-0003-0810-5088; Rimbu, Cristina Mihaela/0000-0003-0982-0040; Ariton, Adina Mirela/0000-0003-1586-2749; NECULAI VALEANU, ANDRA SABINA/0000-0002-6022-583X",ASAS Heritage Foundation [73/25.09.2020],ASAS Heritage Foundation,"This research received funding through the ASAS Heritage Foundation, grant number 73/25.09.2020.",,214,19,19,4,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,JUN,2021,11,6,,,,,,,1625,10.3390/ani11061625,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11061625,,,21,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,SX9VZ,34072849,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000665546100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Copper prices are influenced by supply and demand, national policies, laws, and regulations, and its volatility poses many risks to producers, processors, and consumers. This study selects ten highly correlated factors as input features for the prediction model. These factors include the total copper inventories on the LME and COMEX, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, Brent crude oil price, gold, silver, and iron ore futures prices, as well as the US dollar index, the exchange rate between the United States and China (USD/CNY) and Australia (USD/AUD), and the Shanghai copper price. To create a fully ensemble forecasting model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was selected as the second layer model, and a deep extreme learning machine (DELM) was selected as the first layer single model alongside the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and long and short-term memory networks (LSTM). The hyperparameters of each single model were further optimized with the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to achieve the best results for the ensemble prediction model. The test results indicate that, compared to the single and semi-ensemble models, the fully ensemble model achieves the best copper price prediction results, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.59%, and offers a novel approach for predicting copper price volatility. In addition, the adversarial interpretive structural model (AISM) is introduced to analyze the selected factors, and the influence degree of different categories of factors on the final forecast results is discussed, in order to verify the overall influence of the selected copper price factors on the forecast results.","[Li, Ning; Li, Jiaojiao; Wang, Qizhou; Yan, Dairong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Mineral Resources Proc & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Ning; Li, Jiaojiao; Wang, Qizhou; Yan, Dairong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resource & Environm Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Liguan; Jia, Mingtao] Cent South Univ, Sch Resource & Safety Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology; Central South University,"Wang, QZ (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Hubei Key Lab Mineral Resources Proc & Environm, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",13875910191@163.com; L95338927@163.com; wqz@whut.edu.cn; dryan919@tom.com; 13808478410@163.com; mingtao_jia@163.com,"Li, Jiaojiao/HLX-0161-2023","Li, Ning/0000-0001-8855-9527",National Natural Science Foun-dation of China [42271296]; Major Scientific and Techno-logical Innovation Plan of Hubei Province [2023BEB040]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0605304],National Natural Science Foun-dation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Scientific and Techno-logical Innovation Plan of Hubei Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foun-dation of China (Grant No. 42271296) , Major Scientific and Techno-logical Innovation Plan of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2023BEB040) , and National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.2019YFC0605304) .",,46,4,4,10,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0301-4207,1873-7641,,RESOUR POLICY,Resour.

This review provides a framework to evaluate the health and safety implications of ENM releases into the environment, including purposeful releases such as for antimicrobial sprays or nano-enabled pesticides, and inadvertent releases as a consequence of other intended applications. Considerations encompass product life cycles, environmental media, exposed populations, and possible adverse outcomes. This framework is presented as a series of compartmental flow diagrams that serve as a basis to help derive future quantitative predictive models, guide research, and support development of tools for making risk-based decisions. After use, ENM are not expected to remain in their original form due to reactivity and/or propensity for hetero-agglomeration in environmental media. Therefore, emphasis is placed on characterizing ENM as they occur in environmental or biological matrices. In addition, predicting the activity of ENM in the environment is difficult due to the multiple dynamic interactions between the physical/chemical aspects of ENM and similarly complex environmental conditions. Others have proposed the use of simple predictive functional assays as an intermediate step to address the challenge of using physical/chemical properties to predict environmental fate and behavior of ENM. The nodes and interactions of the framework presented here reflect phase transitions that could be targets for development of such assays to estimate kinetic reaction rates and simplify model predictions. Application, refinement, and demonstration of this framework, along with an associated knowledgebase that includes targeted functional assay data, will allow better de novo predictions of potential exposures and adverse outcomes.","[Boyes, William K.; Thornton, Brittany Lila M.; Hubal, Elaine A.

With the emergence of drug resistance against the current formulations, there is a need to focus on the alternative approaches in order to control this menace. In the present study, biocompatible zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were used to see their in vitro effect on the biliary amphistomes, Gigantocotyle explanatum, infecting Bubalus bubalis because these nanoparticles are involved in generation of free radicals that induce oxidative stress, resulting in disruption of cellular machinery. The ZnO NPs were synthesized by using egg albumin as a biotemplate and subsequently characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction and Spectrophotometrical, which showed that ZnO NPs were highly purified wurtzite type polycrystals, with a mean size of 16.7 nm. When the parasites were treated with lower concentrations (0.004% and 0.008%) of the ZnO NPs, the worms mounted a protective response by stimulating the antioxidant system but the treatment of G. explanatum with 0.012% ZnO NPs produced significant inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p<0.05) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (p<0.01), while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker, was significantly (p<0.01) elevated. SEM and histopathology revealed pronounced tegumental damage showing the disruption of surface papillae and the annulations, particularly in the posterior region near acetabulum. The under expression of a number of polypeptides, loss of worm motility in a time dependent manner, further reflect strong anthelmintic potential of ZnO NPs. It can be concluded that the anthelmintic effect might be due to the production of reactive oxygen species that target a variety of macromolecules such as nucleic acid, protein and lipids which are involved in different cellular processes.","[Khan, Yasir Akhtar; Ullah, Rizwan; Abidi, Syed M.

However, BEFs for trees outside forests like trees in hedgerows are not yet included in the IPCC reports. These are expected to be different from forest trees as hedgerow trees are exposed to more solar radiation and have more growing space. We present age-dependent BEF curves for hedgerow-grown pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), common alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth). We scanned 73 trees in northern Belgium using terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Via quantitative structure models, we estimated total volume and stem volume (diameter greater than 7 cm); we then calculated BEF as the ratio of total volume to stem volume. BEFs decreased exponentially with tree age, converging at 1.18, 1.9 and 1.92 for alder, birch and oak, respectively. For alder, this value is comparable to values of forest-grown alder; for birch and oak, these values are substantially higher, indicating a bigger part of the total volume is branch wood instead of stem wood. Total wood volume in hedgerows varied from 131.2 to 751.8 m(3) per running kilometre, accounting for 30.0 to 222.8 Mg carbon stored, respectively. Only half of the produced wood in hedgerows was classified as stem wood, the other half as branch wood. Our findings show that hedgerow-specific BEFs should be used when applications for biobased economies are drafted. Also, hedgerows should be included in national carbon budgets as they represent non-negligible stocks.","[van den Berge, Sanne; Vangansbeke, Pieter; Vanneste, Thomas; Baeten, Lander; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Forest& Nat Lab, Campus Gontrode,Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium; [Calders, Kim; Verbeeck, Hans; Krishna Moorthy, Sruthi Parvathi] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, CAVElab Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, Campus Coupure,Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"van den Berge, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Forest& Nat Lab, Campus Gontrode,Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium.",sanne.vandenberge@ugent.be,"Vangansbeke, Pieter/AAP-6762-2021; Verbeeck, Hans/A-2106-2009; Baeten, Lander/G-1490-2010; Calders, Kim/O-5369-2017","Krishna Moorthy Parvathi, Sruthi/0000-0002-6838-2880; Verbeeck, Hans/0000-0003-1490-0168; Calders, Kim/0000-0002-4562-2538; Baeten, Lander/0000-0003-4262-9221; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Vanneste, Thomas/0000-0001-5296-917X; Vangansbeke, Pieter/0000-0002-6356-2858; Van Den Berge, Sanne/0000-0001-6155-7097","Special Research Fund (BOF) from Ghent University [01 N02817]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [835398]; BELSPO (Belgian Science Policy Office) in the frame of the STEREO III programme -project 3D-FOREST [SR/02/355]; European Research Council through the PASTFORWARD project (ERC Consolidator Grant) [614839]; European Research Council through the FORMICA project (ERC Starting Grant) [757833]; European Research Council Starting Grant [637643]; European Research Council (ERC) [757833, 637643] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [835398] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)",Special Research Fund (BOF) from Ghent University; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(Marie Curie Actions); BELSPO (Belgian Science Policy Office) in the frame of the STEREO III programme -project 3D-FOREST; European Research Council through the PASTFORWARD project (ERC Consolidator Grant)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council through the FORMICA project (ERC Starting Grant); European Research Council Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),Financial support was provided by the European Research Council to KV through the PASTFORWARD project (ERC Consolidator Grant no. 614839) and to PVG through the FORMICA project (ERC Starting Grant no. 757833).

Among them, the formalization of the domestic service industry can effectively reduce the transaction costs and risks of actors, innovate the endogenous vitality of the industry, and promote the improvement of elderly care quality through a triangular employment relationship. By constructing a tripartite asymmetric evolutionary game model of clients, domestic enterprises and governmental departments, this study uses the stability theorem of differential equations to explore the influencing factors and action paths of the system's evolutionary stable strategies (ESS), and uses the research data collected from China to assign values to models for simulation analysis. This study finds that the ratio of the initial ideal strategy, the difference between profits and costs, subsidies to clients, and subsidies or punishments for breach of contract to domestic enterprises are the key factors affecting the formalization of the domestic service industry. Subsidy policy programs can be divided into long-term and periodic programs, and there are differences in the influence paths and effects of the key factors in different situations. Increasing domestic enterprises' market share with employee management systems, formulating subsidy programs for clients, and setting up evaluation and supervision mechanisms are efficient ways through which to promote the formalization of the domestic service industry in China. Subsidy policy of governmental departments should focus on improving the professional skills and quality of elderly care domestic workers, and also encourage domestic enterprises with employee management systems at the same time, to expand the scope of service beneficiaries by running nutrition restaurants in communities, cooperating with elderly care institutions, etc.","[Ren, Meina; Chang, Xiaozhu; Liu, Linping] Nanjing Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Du, Shasha] Party Sch CPC Jiangsu Comm, Dept Social & Cultural Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Liu, LP (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Social & Behav Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",linpingl@163.com,,"Du, Shasha/0000-0002-3781-6105",Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China [18ASH007],Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China,Funding This work was supported by the Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China under grant no. 18ASH007.,,45,6,6,7,70,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

The nucleophilic addition of terminal alkynes to various unsaturated electrophiles is a classical (textbook) reaction in organic chemistry, allowing the formation of a C-C bond while simultaneously introducing the alkyne functionality. A prerequisite of this classical reaction is the stoichiometric generation of highly reactive metal acetylides. Over the past decade, our laboratory and others have been exploring an alternative, the catalytic and direct nucleophilic addition of terminal alkynes to unsaturated electrophiles in water. We found that various terminal alkynes can react efficiently with a wide range of such electrophiles in water (or organic solvent) in the presence of simple and readily available catalysts, such as copper, silver, gold, iron, palladium, and others. In this Account, we describe the development of these synthetic methods, focusing primarily on results from our laboratory. Our studies include the following: (i) catalytic reaction of terminal alkynes with acid chloride, (ii) catalytic addition of terminal alkynes to aldehydes and ketones, (iii) catalytic addition of alkynes to C=N bonds, and (iv) catalytic conjugate additions. Most importantly, these reactions can tolerate various functional groups and, in many cases, perform better in water than in organic solvents, clearly defying classical reactivities predicated on the relative acidities of water, alcohols, and terminal alkynes. We further discuss multicomponent and enantioselective reactions that were developed. These methods provide an alternative to the traditional requirement of separate steps in classical alkyne reactions, including the pregeneration of metal acetylides with stoichiometric, highly basic reagents and the preprotection of sensitive functional groups. Accordingly, these techniques have greatly enhanced overall synthetic efficiencies and furthered our long-term objective of developing Grignard-type reactions in water.","McGill Univ, Dept Chem, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",McGill University,"Li, CJ (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Chem, 801 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",cj.li@mcgill.ca,"Li, Chao-Jun/G-3522-2019","Li, Chao-Jun/0000-0002-3859-8824",,,,,84,349,362,4,232,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0001-4842,1520-4898,,ACCOUNTS CHEM RES,Accounts Chem.

Significant iodine levels are often found in phosphate ore minerals, which have a distinctive geochemical occurrence. However, the exact occurrence and distribution of iodine in these minerals are not yet thoroughly understood. A study was carried out to investigate the iodine's distribution, occurrence modes (phases), and release rate in Moroccan phosphate as it undergoes the beneficiation process. The samples underwent a multi-analytical approach combining mineralogical and chemical characterization using ICP-MS, ICP-OES, XRD, elements titration, and Pearson correlation analysis for interelement relationships. Calcination, digestion, and Heavy liquid separation is used to study the fate of iodine. The analysis indicates that iodine is primarily found in fluorapatite, with local concentrations ranging from 35 to 130 ppm. The most enriched grains/zones are associated with fluorapatite, enriched in P2O5, F-. in addition, iodine is positively correlated with its main components, including P2O5, F-, SO3, Na2O, CaO, and REEs. The flotation and heavy liquid separation process used for calcite and silicate removal is acting as an iodine and P2O5 concentrator, given that 99 % of iodine occurs in the apatite phase. However, it has been demonstrated that iodine can be released during the digestion of phosphate rock. Where the initial iodine content is distributed among phosphoric acid, PG, and the gaseous phase, constituting 35 %, 25 %, and 40 %, respectively. Furthermore, the calcination of phosphate rock between 800-1000 C-degrees shows that total iodine is released with gases in I-2 form, leading to an increase in the concentration of iodine in the surrounding area. In this regard, an integrated pyrometallurgical process has been proposed for the valorization of iodine as silver iodide. This process involves trapping gaseous iodine in an alkaline solution, followed by precipitation, thereby contributing to the overarching objectives of the circular economy and environmental protection.","[Benali, Kamal; Benhida, Rachid; Khaless, Khaoula] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Green Proc Engn Dept CBS, Chem & Biochem Sci, Benguerir, Morocco; [Benhida, Rachid] Cote Azur Univ, Inst Chem Nice, UMR7272, Nice, France; [El Mahdi, Mounir] OCP Grp, El Jadida 24025, Morocco",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Khaless, K (通讯作者)，Mohammed VI Polytech Univ, Green Proc Engn Dept CBS, Chem & Biochem Sci, Benguerir, Morocco.",Khaoula.Khaless@um6p.ma,"benali, kamal/KHY-0991-2024","BENALI, Kamal/0000-0002-2982-8296",OCP innovation,OCP innovation,All the authors gratefully acknowledge UM6P and OCP innovation for their financial support to CBS.GPE program.,,30,1,1,2,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0957-5820,1744-3598,,PROCESS SAF ENVIRON,Process Saf.

Under the promotion of proton acid, simple pyridines react with isocyanides to provide 2-picolinamides by means of the aminocar-bonylation of the aryl C-H bond in the C2 position of pyridines. The product formation involves in the electrophilic addition of isocyanide to pyridine ring, hydrolysis and the oxidative aromatization regenerating pyridine ring in the presence of Di-t-butyl peroxide (DTBP) and oxalic acid dihydrate. Control experiments in the optimization section disclose the fact that the proton acid and oxidant are both indispensable for this C-H bond aminocarbonylation reaction. Generally, the synthetic reactions run smoothly under air atmosphere by heating all the substrates and reagents in one-pot at 100 degrees C. The pyridine substrates containing methyl, t-butyl, cyclic dialkyl, methoxyl, halogen substituents at different site of the pyridine ring have displayed fine tolerance to the synthesis of corresponding products with diverse substructures in the pyridine ring. On the other hand, both alkyl and aryl functionalized isocyanides have also been found applicable to this synthetic protocol to provide 2-picolinamides containing correspondingly various N-alkyl and N-aryl fragment. The primary results indicate that the stability of the isocyanide substrate evidently influence the reaction result. The reactions employing relatively more stable 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide give corresponding products with higher yield than those ones using other isocyanides. Comparing with those reported methods employing transition metal catalyst such as silver or palladium salt to activate the C2-H bond in pyridines for the synthesis of analogous products, the present method benefits from the distinctive features of totally metal-free catalysis, broad substrate tolerance, specific regioselectivity in transforming C2-H bond, and high atom economy. Therefore, such a synthetic method will reasonably be a practical approach in complementing those already known strategies for the synthesis of structurally diverse and useful 2-picolinamide scaffolds.","[Wang Yuyun; Liu Yuyun] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University,"Liu, YY (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",chemliuyunyun@jxnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [21562024],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21562024).,,45,21,21,1,42,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0567-7351,,,ACTA CHIM SINICA,Acta Chim.

Based on questionnaires distributed to the relevant authorities we estimated the number of trees damaged by bears in 1991-2013, changes in the tree species composition and large-scale factors potentially affecting the extent of damage. We also discuss the importance of bear tree damage to forest management. Throughout the 23 years of the study we recorded 6937 trees damaged by bears: a clearly increasing trend and distinct fluctuations in tree numbers and species composition were discernible. Conifers (91.7% - fir 70.0%, larch 11.3%, spruce 9.5%, pine 0.9%) were more frequently damaged than deciduous species (2.9%). Larch and spruce were preferentially affected during the whole study period, and the preference for larch was distinct when collated with its availability in forest stands - a forage ratio of 0.50 compared to 0.35 for fir, 0.17 for spruce and 0.13 for pine. In 2003, however, bears suddenly switched to fir and it is this species that now predominates among the damaged trees, reaching 96.5% in 2013. Two models based on minimum AIC(c) values were best explaining damage to trees. The most parsimonious model contained one explanatory variable: brown bear population size. The second best model included both bear population size and the average fir tree-ring width. Neither fluctuations in daily temperatures nor the number of days with snow cover had any influence on the scale of damage. Our findings suggest that damage caused by bears is not to be regarded as a serious problem by forest management in Poland and it is unlikely to reach a level of economic significance in the short term.

Recently, the use of essential oils and polyphenol-enriched extracts is also rapidly increasing in the aquaculture sector as a means of greater industrial and environmental sustainability. Previous studies assessed the antibacterial and antiparasitic effects of these bioactive compounds on fish. However, studies on the modulation of oxidative stress biomarkers are still scant to date. Thus, in this study, the modulation of antioxidant defense against oxidative stress exerted by fish diets supplemented with a basil supercritical extract (F1-BEO) was assessed in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The F1-BEO extracted with supercritical fluid extraction was added to the commercial feed flour (0.5, 1, 2, 3% w/w) and mixed with fish oil to obtain a suitable compound for pellet preparation. Fish were fed for 30 days. The levels of stress biomarkers such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione and malondialdehyde showed a boost in the antioxidant pathway in fish fed with a 0.5% F1-BEO-supplemented diet. Higher F1-BEO supplementation led to a failure of activity of several enzymes and the depletion of glutathione levels. Malondialdehyde concentration suggests a sufficient oxidative stress defense against lipid peroxidation in all experimental groups, except for a 3% F1-BEO-supplemented diet (liver 168.87 +/- 38.79 nmol/mg prot; kidney 146.86 +/- 23.28 nmol/mg prot), compared to control (liver 127.76 +/- 18.15 nmol/mg prot; kidney 98.68 +/- 15.65 nmol/mg prot). Our results suggest supplementing F1-BEO in fish diets up to 0.5% to avoid potential oxidative pressure in farmed trout.","[Magara, Gabriele; Caldaroni, Barbara; Elia, Antonia Concetta] Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Prearo, Marino; Dondo, Alessandro; Pastorino, Paolo] Vet Med Res Inst Piemonte Liguria & Valle Aosta, I-10154 Turin, Italy; [Vercelli, Cristina; Re, Giovanni] Univ Torino, Dept Vet Sci, I-10095 Turin, Italy; [Barbero, Raffaella] ASL TO4, Serv Vet Igiene Allevamenti & Prod Zootecn, I-10036 Turin, Italy; [Micera, Marco; Botto, Alfonso] Exenia Grp SRL, I-10064 Turin, Italy; [Micera, Marco; Bertea, Cinzia Margherita; Mannino, Giuseppe] Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Caimi, Christian; Gasco, Laura] Univ Torino, Dept Agr Forest & Food Sci, I-10095 Turin, Italy; [Barcelo, Damia] Catalan Inst Water Res ICRA, Girona 17003, Spain; [Barcelo, Damia] CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Renzi, Monia] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Turin; University of Turin; University of Turin; Institut Catala de Recerca de l'Aigua (ICRA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Diagnostico Ambiental y Estudios del Agua (IDAEA); University of Trieste,"Pastorino, P (通讯作者)，Vet Med Res Inst Piemonte Liguria & Valle Aosta, I-10154 Turin, Italy.;Mannino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",magara.gabriele@gmail.com; marino.prearo@izsto.it; cristina.vercelli@unito.it; rbarbero@aslto4.piemonte.it; marco.micera@unito.it; info@exeniagroup.it; christian.caimi@unito.it; bcaldaroni@gmail.com; cinzia.bertea@unito.it; giuseppe.mannino@unito.it; dbcqam@cid.csic.es; mrenzi@units.it; laura.gasco@unito.it; giovanni.re@unito.it; alessandro.dondo@izsto.it; antonia.elia@unipg.it; paolo.pastorino@izsto.it,"Gasco, Laura/ADE-4591-2022; Vercelli, Cristina/AAG-3772-2021; BARCELO, DAMIA/O-4558-2016; Barbero, Raffaella/O-3840-2019; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019; Renzi, Monia/AAM-8333-2020; Elia, Antonia/F-4646-2014; Bertea, Cinzia/AAH-6434-2019; Mannino, Giuseppe/AAG-3518-2019","Renzi, Monia/0000-0003-2452-1698; Bertea, Cinzia Margherita/0000-0003-2919-0445; Mannino, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0047-978X; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; Vercelli, Cristina/0000-0001-7766-4647; GASCO, Laura/0000-0002-1829-7936; CAIMI, CHRISTIAN/0000-0001-9381-5126; RE, Giovanni/0000-0002-2024-143X; Prearo, Marino/0000-0002-2847-6006; Barbero, Raffaella/0000-0003-4497-6382","Italian Ministry of Health, Ricerca Finalizzata [GR-2013-02355796]","Italian Ministry of Health, Ricerca Finalizzata(Ministry of Health, Italy)","FundingThis research was funded by Italian Ministry of Health, Ricerca Finalizzata, grant number GR-2013-02355796.",,82,18,18,3,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3921,,ANTIOXIDANTS-BASEL,Antioxidants,FEB,2022,11,2,,,,,,,415,10.3390/antiox11020415,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox11020415,,,20,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Medicinal; Food Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Food Science & Technology,ZK0SJ,35204297,"gold, Green Published",,,2025-05-09,WOS:000762707100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multicomponent reactions aim towards greener chemical transformations, mostly due to their step economy. The A(3) coupling is a widely-studied multicomponent reaction, bringing together aldehydes, amines, and alkynes in a one pot manner, towards tertiary propargylamines, which are highly useful compounds with a variety of applications. The majority of reported synthetic protocols towards propargylamines require the preceding preparation of other starting materials, resulting in the need for increased time investment and cost, as well as encompassing a negative environmental impact. On the other hand, the A(3) reaction requires simple, widely-available starting materials and can be completed in one step, making it immensely superior to the conventional approaches. This transformation is carried out by transition metal-based catalysts, which generate the necessary metal acetylides and merge them with the in situ generated aldimines/aldimine cations. Unfortunately, though, due to stereochemical and electronic reasons, ketimines/ketimine cations are way less reactive than their aldimine/aldimine cation counterparts, against nucleophilic attack, making their use in analogous transformations more challenging. This is why only 10 years have passed since the first KA(2) reaction was reported (i.e. the one-pot coupling of a ketone with an amine and an alkyne towards quaternary propargylamines). The present review article provides a brief introduction to multicomponent reactions, the existing conventional synthetic routes towards propargylamines, and the A(3) coupling reaction. A detailed, critical discussion of all KA(2) homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic protocols, the mechanisms proposed, as well as the difficulties encountered and the strategies employed to circumvent them follows.

The analogous reaction of 1-(2-(phenylselanyl)ethyl)-1H-imidazole with 2-bromoethyl phenyl sulfide has also resulted in a imidazolium bromide (L3) which is a precursor of novel S,C-NHC,Se type pincer ligand. The route of silver-NHC transmetalation was employed to get the palladium complexes [Pd(L1/L2-HBr)Cl-2] (C1 and C2) and [Pd(L3-HBr)Cl]BF4 (C3). The imidazolium bromide (L1-L3) and palladium complexes (C1-C3) were characterized by using multinuclear NMR and HR-MS. The structure and bonding in the complexes C1 and C2 were validated by X-ray crystallography. Thermally robust and moisture/air insensitive palladium complexes C1-C3 have been explored in the catalysis of C-H bond arylation of imidazoles. The protocol operates under mild reaction conditions in air with an excellent regioselective C-H bond arylation at C-5 position in imidazoles. All the complexes were found to be efficient (yield up to 97 % in 12 h) in the catalysis; however, the activating pincer ligand framework containing Pd catalyst C3, was found to be utmost effective among the three catalysts. Only 0.5 mol-% catalyst loading is required to achieve admirable yield of the desired cross-coupled products. A wide range of substrates was examined, and the developed protocol was applicable to all derivatives with high functional group tolerance and greater efficiency. More importantly, the catalyst C3 has also been found recyclable up to five cycles with minor decrease in efficiency which is highly desirable feature for the development of economical and sustainable industrial reaction processes. The PPh3 and Hg poisoning tests have established the complete homogeneous nature of the catalysis.","[Bhatt, Ramprasad] Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Chem, Pilani Campus, Pilani 333031, Rajasthan, India; [Bhuvanesh, Nattamai] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Chem, POB 30012, College Stn, TX 77842 USA; [Sharma, Kamal Nayan] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol Jaipur, Dept Chem, JLN Marg, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Sharma, Kamal Nayan] AUH, Dept Chem, ASAS, Manesar 122413, Gurgaon, India; [Joshi, Hemant] Cent Univ Rajasthan, Sch Chem Sci & Pharm, Dept Chem, NH 8, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India",Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur; Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ),"Sharma, KN (通讯作者)，Malaviya Natl Inst Technol Jaipur, Dept Chem, JLN Marg, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India.;Sharma, KN (通讯作者)，AUH, Dept Chem, ASAS, Manesar 122413, Gurgaon, India.;Joshi, H (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Rajasthan, Sch Chem Sci & Pharm, Dept Chem, NH 8, Ajmer 305817, Rajasthan, India.",kamalnayaniitd@gmail.com; hemant.joshi@curaj.ac.in,"Joshi, Hemant/AAF-4578-2020; Sharma, Kamal Nayan/G-8944-2016","Sharma, Kamal Nayan/0000-0001-5919-3861; Joshi, Hemant/0000-0002-7616-0241","Department of Science and Technology (DST) Inspire [DST/INSPIRE/04/2017/002162]; DST [SR/FST/CSI-270/2015]; SERB, New Delhi","Department of Science and Technology (DST) Inspire; DST(Department of Science & Technology (India)); SERB, New Delhi","H.

There is a desire to develop new protection technologies to address these issues and promote the development of the marine economy. The preparation of superhydrophobic coatings on substrates is currently becoming an attractive method in the field of metal protection. In this study, a novel approach for fabricating superhydrophobic Co/Ag composite coating using a simplified one-step electrodeposition technique was developed. The superhydrophobicity was achieved through the codeposition of stearic acid, Co2 + ions, and Ag nanoparticles. A cauliflower-like rough structure was observed on the carbon steel substrate. Wettability testing revealed that the resultant composite coating exhibited excellent superhydrophobic performance, with a water contact angle (CA) of 163.8 degrees and a sliding angle (SA) as low as 3.5 degrees. The dynamic behavior of water droplets on the surface of the coating was studied, and the surface adhesion work was measured. The extraordinary hydrophobic property of the coating resulted in a significant delay in the freezing time of the droplets on the surface, with a value of 344 s observed at a temperature of -10 degrees C. Through testing using the cross-cut tape peeling and sandpaper abrasion, the produced coating's mechanical robustness was confirmed. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic coating was proven to possess excellent chemical resistance and thermal stability. The mechanisms of anti-corrosion and antibiofouling for the resulting coating were discussed. The corrosion current density of the superhydrophobic coating was two orders of magnitude lower than that of bare steel, thereby significantly improving corrosion resistance. Moreover, This Co/Ag composite coating exhibited an effective anti-biofouling capability towards Bacillus sp. and P. tricornutum because of its remarkable water repellency and the inherent anti-bacterial properties of Ag nanoparticles. Thus, the resulting coating can provide reliable protection for metal materials used in marine environments.","[Tan, Hao; Yin, Huawei; Luo, Yinqiu; Lan, Bo; Li, Tingzhen; Hu, Chuanbo] Chongqing Three Gorges Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, Key Lab Water Environm Evolut & Pollut Control Thr, Chongqing 404100, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yongjia] Chongqing Special Equipment Inspection & Res Inst, Chongqing 401121, Peoples R China; [Li, Tingzhen] Chongqing Chem Ind Vocat Coll, Chongqing 401228, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chuanbo] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Chem, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chuanbo] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Mineral Salt Deep, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China",Chongqing Three Gorges University; Hong Kong Baptist University; Huaiyin Institute of Technology,"Yin, HW; Hu, CB (通讯作者)，Chongqing Three Gorges Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, Key Lab Water Environm Evolut & Pollut Control Thr, Chongqing 404100, Peoples R China.",huaweiyin@aliyun.com; chuanbohu@sanxiau.edu.cn,"Yin, Huawei/GXF-3836-2022",,"Opening Fund of National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Mineral Salt Deep Utilization, Huaiyin Institute of Technology [SF202206]; Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Education Commission [KJQN202001243, KJQN202201214, KJZD-M202301201, KJZD-K202304502]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing of China [cstc2021jcyj-msxmX1139, CSTB2024NSCQ-MSX1013]","Opening Fund of National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Mineral Salt Deep Utilization, Huaiyin Institute of Technology; Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Education Commission; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing of China(Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing)","The funding for this work was provided by the Opening Fund of National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Mineral Salt Deep Utilization, Huaiyin Institute of Technology [grant number SF202206] , the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Education Commission [grant numbers KJQN202001243, KJQN202201214, KJZD-M202301201, KJZD-K202304502] , the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing of China [grant numbers cstc2021jcyj-msxmX1139, CSTB2024NSCQ-MSX1013] .",,80,1,1,22,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-7757,1873-4359,,COLLOID SURFACE A,Colloid Surf.

It causes destruction of forests and threat to crop plantations, thus affecting the agriculture-based economy of a country. As an attempt to mitigate this problem, we have studied the applicability of M. micrantha flower essential oil against disease causing microorganisms and inhibition of cancerous cells. Sixty-six compounds were characterized from the flower essential oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major constituents were: Isoledene (16%), delta-Cadinene (11.2%), Debromofiliformin (9.4%), Trans-Caryophyllene (9.1%), beta-Bisabolene (7.4%), Germacrene-D (5.8%), and Zingiberene (5.3%). The oil is a complex mixture containing mainly sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (62.9%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (23.9%) with the other terpene compounds. Well-diffusion and resazurin assay were conducted to determine antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oil. Flower oil showed best activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Candida albicans with MIC 8 mu g/mL. Moreover, it is the first report of antimicrobial activity of the oil towards M. smegmatis, C. albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentration was determined and mechanism of antimicrobial activity was investigated by Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis. It is the first cytotoxicity report of M. micrantha flower essential oil for cervical, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Through MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, we have found that oil has excellent cytotoxicity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines (IC50 5.44 +/- 1.33 mu g/mL) and PA1 ovarian cancer cell lines (IC(50)10.57 +/- 1.44 mu g/mL). The essential oil extracted from the invasive weed M. micrantha flower is now found to have antimicrobial and anticancer properties from our study. Thus, this harmful weed can be utilized as antimicrobial and anticancer agents for the healthcare of human being.","[Saikia, Snigdha; Tamuli, Kashyap J.; Narzary, Bardwi; Bordoloi, Manobjyoti] CSIR North East Inst Sci & Technol, Chem Sci & Technol Div, Jorhat 785006, Assam, India; [Banik, Dipanwita] CSIR North East Inst Sci & Technol, Med Aromat & Econ Plants Grp, Jorhat 785006, Assam, India; [Saikia, Snigdha; Tamuli, Kashyap J.; Banik, Dipanwita; Bordoloi, Manobjyoti] CSIR North East Inst Sci & Technol, Acad Sci & Innovat Res, Jorhat 785006, Assam, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - North East Institute of Science & Technology (NEIST); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - North East Institute of Science & Technology (NEIST); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - North East Institute of Science & Technology (NEIST); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR),"Bordoloi, M (通讯作者)，CSIR North East Inst Sci & Technol, Chem Sci & Technol Div, Jorhat 785006, Assam, India.;Bordoloi, M (通讯作者)，CSIR North East Inst Sci & Technol, Acad Sci & Innovat Res, Jorhat 785006, Assam, India.",m.j.bordoloi.pub@gmail.com,,"TAMULI, KASHYAP JYOTI/0000-0002-3110-5644","CSIR, DBT New Delhi [GPP-346, 102/IFD/SAN/2241/2018/2019, CSC-0130, CSC-0207, OLP-2020]; MoTA, New Delhi [201718-NFST-ASS-00448]","CSIR, DBT New Delhi; MoTA, New Delhi","We thank the Director, CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology, Jorhat, Assam for providing facilities and CSIR, DBT [GPP-346, Sl No. 102/IFD/SAN/2241/2018/2019] New Delhi for the grant of projects [CSC-0130 & 0207 & OLP-2020].

However, the selective recovery of gold from e-waste is a significant challenge due to its heterogeneous nature and existing inappropriate recovering processes. Considering these issues, in this study, we investigated a promising approach for recovering gold from waste random access memory (WRAM). For that, we synthesized a porous nanonet polymer (Por-net) through a one-pot Friedel-Crafts polymerization method containing multiple functional groups, i.e., porphyrin and triphenylamine, within a single framework material, acting as a bifunctional chelating ligand. The adsorption results were significantly influenced by the pH conditions. Around 1250 mg g(-1) capacity of Au was recovered under realistic experimental conditions in an acidic medium. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm and kinetic study revealed the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic fittings for the Au adsorption on Por-net. Properties such as the high surface area and structure of Por-net as well as the Au@Por-net polymer were comprehensively characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), solid-state( 13)C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR, N2 sorption analysis field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), ultraviolet (UV)-visible, time-resolved photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed its efficient potential for recovering gold from real e-waste sources. Por-net showed excellent desorption efficiency, recyclability, selectivity, and chemical stability. At last, the economic feasibility of Por-net for the purpose of recovering gold from e-waste is also explored. The present work represents a greener and feasible approach to promoting sustainable development, circular economy, and responsible waste management using an effective porous polymer as a scaffold.","[Preetam, Amrita; Naik, Satya Narayan; Kumar, Vivek] Indian Inst Technol IIT Delhi, Ctr Rural Dev & Technol, Delhi 110016, India; [Preetam, Amrita; Modak, Arindam] Indian Inst Technol IIT Delhi, Dept Chem Engn, Delhi 110016, India; [Pant, Kamal Kishore] Indian Inst Technol IIT Delhi, Delhi 110016, India; [Modak, Arindam] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Appl Sci AIAS, Noida 201301, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Amity University Noida,"Modak, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol IIT Delhi, Dept Chem Engn, Delhi 110016, India.;Pant, KK (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol IIT Delhi, Delhi 110016, India.;Modak, A (通讯作者)，Amity Univ, Amity Inst Appl Sci AIAS, Noida 201301, Uttar Pradesh, India.",arindam_modak_2006@yahoo.co.in; kkpant@chemical.iitd.ac.in,"Kumar, Vivek/U-6843-2019; Modak, Arindam/P-3762-2016; Modak, Arindam/HSD-2225-2023","Modak, Arindam/0000-0001-6044-6942",Indian Institute of Technology Delhi; Office of Principal Scientific Adviser; Government of India; IIT Delhi; CRF of IIT Delhi,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi; Office of Principal Scientific Adviser; Government of India; IIT Delhi; CRF of IIT Delhi,"The authors acknowledge the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India for funding the DRIIV project and IIT Delhi for giving funding facilities.

Storing cheap renewable electricity into chemical bonds (i.e., chemical energy storage) could be a transformative opportunity for reliable and resilient grid energy storage. This approach enables renewables to be stored and shipped similarly to fossil fuels. Currently, the chemical industry primarily consumes fossil feedstock as an energy source, which has been the standard for over a century. A paradigm shift is required to move toward a more sustainable route for chemical synthesis by electrifying and decarbonizing the modern chemical industry. As renewable electricity costs decrease, (photo)electrosynthesis is gaining interest for synthesizing high-value and high-energy fuels and molecules in a clean, sustainable, and decentralized manner. The nitrogen cycle is one of the Earth's most critical biogeochemical cycles since nitrogen is a vital element for all living organisms. Artificial nitrogen fixation via a (photo)electrochemical system powered by renewables provides an alternative route to resource- and carbon-intensive thermochemical processes. (Photo)electrochemical nitrogen fixation at a large scale necessitates the discovery of active, selective, and stable heterogeneous (photo)electrocatalysts. In addition, the use of advanced in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques is needed to pinpoint the underlying reaction mechanisms. The selectivity of nitrogen (N2) molecules on the catalyst surface and suppressing thermodynamically favorable side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction) are the main bottlenecks in improving the rate of (photo)electrochemical nitrogen fixation in aqueous solutions. The rational design of electrode, electrolyte, and reactors is required to weaken the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond (N=N) at or near ambient conditions. This Account covers our group's recent advances in synthesizing shape-controlled hybrid plasmonic nanoparticles, including plasmonic-semiconductor and plasmonic- transition metal nanostructures with increased surface areas. The nanocatalysts' selectivity and activity toward nitrogen conversion are benchmarked in liquid- and gas-phase electrochemical systems. We leverage operando vibrational-type spectroscopy (i.e., surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)) to identify intermediate species relevant to nitrogen fixation at the electrode-electrolyte interface to gain mechanistic insights into reaction mechanisms, leading to the discovery of more efficient catalysts. Operando SERS revealed that the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia on hybrid plasmonic-transition metal nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., Pd-Ag) occurs through an associative mechanism. In the NRR process, hydrazine (N2H4) is consumed as an intermediate species. A femtosecond pulsed laser is used to synthesize hybrid plasmonic photocatalysts with homogeneously distributed Pd atoms on a Au nanorod surface, resulting in enhanced optoelectronic and catalytic properties. The overarching goal is to develop modular photoelectrochemical systems for long-duration renewable energy storage. In the context of nitrogen fixation, we aim to propose strategies to manage the nitrogen cycle through the interconversion of N2 and active nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., NH3, NOx), enabling a circular nitrogen economy with sustainable and positive social and economic outcomes. The versatile approaches presented in this Account can inform future opportunities in (photo)electrochemical energy conversion systems and solar fuel-based applications.","[Nazemi, Mohammadreza; El-Sayed, Mostafa A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Nazemi, M; El-Sayed, MA (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",mrnazemi@gatech.edu; melsayed@gatech.edu,"El-Sayed, Mostafa/B-3767-2013","Nazemi, Mohammadreza/0000-0002-1735-9277",National Science Foundation [1904351]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Chemistry [1904351] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Chemistry(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1904351.

We investigated resilience to an ice storm event, followed by a spruce bark beetle outbreak and subsequent salvage logging in a temperate sub-montane forest landscape in Slovenia. The study landscape was characterized by a gradient in pre-disturbance proportion of spruce, an important species for the forest economy, ranging from mixed fir-beech-spruce forest to spruce monocultures. Given that the bark beetle only affected spruce, this gradient in spruce proportion provided an opportunity to investigate forest resilience across a severity gradient ranging from undamaged areas to complete canopy removal over patches of several hectares. We assessed multiple dimensions of resilience across this disturbance severity gradient, namely i) post-disturbance forest structural and species diversity, ii) radial growth of surviving trees, and iii) post-disturbance regeneration, including measurements made in deer exclosures. The results highlight the low resilience of spruce-dominated stands in terms of low structural and species diversity of the recovering forests, once spruce is removed due to disturbance. However, measures of post-disturbance structural diversity were higher in stands were spruce made up < 50 % of the tree composition. This result may help forest managers to plan how much spruce to maintain in mixture with species less vulnerable to climate change. We also showed that surviving canopy trees with damaged crowns can sustain high radial growth resilience, which calls into question the efficacy of immediate post-disturbance salvaging of damaged trees. Finally, we quantified the detrimental impact of ungulate browsing on the recruitment of post-disturbance regeneration, particularly for highly palatable species, which showed significantly lower aggregate height, a metric combining density and tree height, outside of deer exclosures. We stress the importance of actively controlling ungulate populations for successful post-disturbance recruitment of silviculturally important palatable species, such as silver fir and sycamore maple.","[Cerioni, Matteo; Klopcic, Matija; Rozenbergar, Dusan; Nagel, Thomas A.] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Vecna Pot 83, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Cerioni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry & Renewable Forest Resources, Vecna Pot 83, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matteo.cerioni@bf.uni-lj.si,"Cerioni, Matteo/JOK-7070-2023",,Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS),Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),"Thanks to Srdjan Keren for the R function to calculate Gini coeffi-cient; Blaz y Fricelj, Tim Pirc, Hana S y traus, Eva Knific, Gal Fidej, Jeanne Soubeyran, Vera Zgonik, Tine Ferk, Luka Seidl for the help with the field work.

This COVID-19 created an adverse impact on human life, economic, environment, and energy and transport sector compared to the pre-COVID-19 scenario. These above-mentioned sectors are interrelated and thus lockdown strategy and stay at home rules to reduce the COVID-19 transmission had a drastic effect on them. With lockdown, all industry and transport sectors were closed, energy demand reduced greatly but the time shift of energy demand had a critical impact on grid and energy generation. Decreased energy demand caused a silver lining with an improved environment. However, drowned economy creating a negative impact on the human mind and financial condition, which at times led to life-ending decisions. Transport sector which faced a financial dip last year trying to coming out from the losses which are not feasible without government aid and a new customer-friendly policy. Sustainable transport and the electric vehicle should take high gear. While people are staying at home or using work from home scheme, building indoor environment must specially be taken care of as a compromised indoor environment affects and increases the risk of many diseases. Also, the energy-efficient building will play a key role to abate the enhanced building energy demand and more generation from renewable sources should be in priority. It is still too early to predict any forecast about the regain period of all those sectors but with vaccination now being introduced and implemented but still, it can be considered as an ongoing process as its final results are yet to be seen. As of now, COVID-19 still continue to grow in certain areas causing anxiety and destruction. With all these causes, effects, and restoration plans, still SDGs will be suffered in great order to attain their target by 2030 and collaborative support from all countries can only help in this time.","[Nundy, Srijita] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Adv Mat Sci & Engn, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Ghosh, Aritra] Univ Exeter, Renewable Energy, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Mesloub, Abdelhakim; Albaqawy, Ghazy Abdullah; Alnaim, Mohammed Mashary] Hail Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Hail 2440, Saudi Arabia",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); University of Exeter; University Ha'il,"Ghosh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Renewable Energy, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",ghosh@exeter.ac.uk,"Albaqawy, Ghazy/AAP-4257-2021; Mesloub, Abdelhakim/AAZ-1981-2020; Ghosh, Aritra/AGU-0899-2022; AlNaim, Mohammed/ISV-0599-2023","Nundy, Srijta/0000-0002-9885-9432; Albaqawy, Ghazy/0000-0001-9232-216X; mesloub, abdelhakim/0000-0002-4513-8105; Alnaim, Mohammed/0000-0003-3591-4323",,,,,311,172,177,4,102,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Patients suffer from pain and functional impairment in activities of daily life which are associated with a decrease in quality of life. Conservative therapeutic interventions such as physical exercises aim at reducing pain and increasing function and health-related quality of life. However, there is only silver level evidence for efficacy of land-based physical exercise in the treatment of hip OA. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the specific 12-week exercise regime Hip School can decrease bodily pain and improve physical function and life quality in subjects with hip osteoarthritis. Methods/Design: 217 participants with hip OA, confirmed using the clinical score of the American College of Rheumatology, are recruited from the community and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) exercise regime Hip School, n = 70; (2) Non-intervention control group, n = 70; (3) Sham ultrasound group, n = 70; (4) Ultrasound group, n = 7. The exercise regime combines group exercises (1/week, 60-90') and home-based exercises (2/week, 30-40'). Sham ultrasound and ultrasound are given once a week, 15'. Measures are taken directly prior to (M1) and after (M2) the 12-week intervention period. Two follow-ups are conducted by phone 16 and 40 weeks after the intervention period. The primary outcome measure is the change in the subscale bodily pain of the SF36 from M1 to M2. Secondary outcomes comprise the WOMAC score, SF36, isometric strength of hip muscles, spatial-temporal and discrete measures derived from clinical gait analysis, and the length of the centre of force path in different standing tasks. An intension-to-treat analysis will be performed using multivariate statistics (group x time). Discussion: Results from this trial will contribute to the evidence regarding the effect of a hip-specific exercise regime on physical function, pain, and health-related quality of life in patients with hip osteoarthritis.","[Krauss, Inga; Steinhilber, Benjamin; Haupt, Georg; Miller, Regina; Grau, Stefan; Janssen, Pia] Univ Tubingen, Med Clin, Dept Sports Med, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Krauss, I (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Med Clin, Dept Sports Med, Tubingen, Germany.",inga.krauss@med.uni-tuebingen.de,"Steinhilber, Benjamin/AAX-6286-2021; Grau, Stefan/HMV-9707-2023",,Theraband(R); Artzt(R),Theraband(R); Artzt(R),Exercise material for this trial is funded by Theraband (R) and Artzt (R).

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are composed of the most concentrated critical elements (Ag and Au) and recovery of these metals could generate economic benefits and reduce the burdens of environmental pollution; nevertheless, the absence of information about their composition currently presents a challenge in recycling these metals with minimal prospects for recovery. This study assessed the distribution and variation of elemental concentrations of 16 different elements in three generations of LEDs (12 different LED units): sub-mounted -device (SMD #10), chip-on-board (COB #1), and positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN #1). The SMD LEDs con-tained a considerable amount of Au with a median average concentration of 1204 mg/kg (ranging from 323 -3687 mg/kg), which was similar to that of COB (1550 mg/kg), but higher than that of PIN LED (175 mg/kg). Based on the total threshold limiting concentration (TTLC), the Cu levels (605,823 mg/kg) in the SMD package exceeded the regulatory limits (2500 mg/kg). Concentrations of the hazardous elements Cr (29 mg/kg), Pb (12 mg/kg), Cd (0.1 mg/kg), and As (1 mg/kg) in the LED packages were within the regulatory limits. To recycle precious metals and other technological metals, a well-organized and dedicated optimized assessment of the value of metals is required especially in accordance with the concept of criticality and recyclability. Two factors, i.e., a high resource index (RI) and technology index (TI), suggest the importance of waste to the economy and has a significant potential for recycling with less processing burdens. Present findings indicated that the COB and a few of the studied SMD LEDs (3020, 4014, 5630, and 7020), exhibit high criticality and recyclability. For the RI and TI index, the contribution of metals such as Cu, Fe, Al, and Au were dominant. These findings can serve as a reference for the development of a viable approach for the recycling and recovery of targeted metals from LED e -waste.","[Mandal, Sandip; Bakaruddin, Balqis Raihan Binti; Jeon, Seongbeom; Lee, Yunho; Kim, Kyoung-Woong] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol GIST, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Engn, Gwangju, South Korea",Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST),"Lee, Y; Kim, KW (通讯作者)，Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol GIST, Sch Earth Sci & Environm Engn, Gwangju, South Korea.",yhlee42@gist.ac.kr; kwkim@gist.ac.kr,"Jeon, SeongBeom/JRH-2179-2023; MANDAL, SANDIP/E-7968-2011","/0000-0002-4535-2048; Lee, Yunho/0000-0001-5923-4897; Jeon, SeongBeom/0000-0003-3505-5821","National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning [NRF-2017M3A7B4042273]; GIST Research Institute (GRI) - GIST","National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); GIST Research Institute (GRI) - GIST","This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (NRF-2017M3A7B4042273) and GIST Research Institute (GRI) , a grant funded by the GIST in 2022.",,41,2,2,0,10,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Developing approaches to detect the presence of invasive species, favorable habitats for their establishment, and predicting their potential spread are underutilized management strategies to effectively protect the environment and the economy. Spotted lanternfly (SLF, Lycorma delicatula) is a phloem-feeding planthopper native to China that poses a severe threat to horticultural and forest products in the United States. Tools are being developed to contain the spread and damage caused by SLF; however, methods to rapidly detect novel infestations or low-density populations are lacking. Vegetation spectroscopy is an approach that can represent vegetation health through changes in the reflectance and absorption of radiation based on plant physiochemical status. Here, we hypothesize that SLF infestations change the spectral and chemical characteristics of tree canopies. To test this hypothesis, we used a full range spectroradiometer to sample canopy foliage of silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and red maple (Acer rubrum) trees in a common garden in Berks County, Pennsylvania that were exposed to varying levels of SLF infestation. Foliar spectral profiles separated between SLF infestation levels, and the magnitude of separation was greater for the zero-SLF control compared with higher infestation levels. We found the red-edge and portions of the NIR and SWIR regions were most strongly related to SLF infestation densities and that corresponding changes in vegetation indexes related to levels of chlorophyll were influenced by SLF infestations, although we found no change in foliar levels of chlorophyll. We found no influence of SLF densities on levels of primary metabolites (i.e., pigments, nonstructural carbohydrates, carbon, and nitrogen), but did find an increase in the phenolic compound ferulic acid in response to increasing SLF infestations; this response was only in red maple, suggesting a possible species-specific response related to SLF feeding. By identifying changes in spectral and chemical properties of canopy leaves in response to SLF infestation, we can link them together to potentially better understand how trees respond to SLF feeding pressure and more rapidly identify SLF infestations.","[Joll, Elisabeth G.; Ginzel, Matthew D.; Couture, John J.] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ginzel, Matthew D.; Couture, John J.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hoover, Kelli] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16082 USA; [Couture, John J.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Plant Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Penn State Behrend; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Couture, JJ (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Couture, JJ (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Couture, JJ (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Ctr Plant Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",joll@purdue.edu; mginzel@purdue.edu; kxh25@psu.edu; couture@purdue.edu,,,"USDA NIFA AFRI [00097118]; Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center (HTIRC); Institute for Digital Forestry at Purdue University; USDANIFA [IND011490]; Northeast Multistate Chemical Ecology [NE2001]; Harnessing Chemical Ecology to Address Agricultural Pests and USDA Hatch Project Accession [1021211, PEN04728]",USDA NIFA AFRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center (HTIRC); Institute for Digital Forestry at Purdue University; USDANIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Northeast Multistate Chemical Ecology; Harnessing Chemical Ecology to Address Agricultural Pests and USDA Hatch Project Accession,"This work was funded by USDA NIFA AFRI grant 00097118 to JJC, MDG, and KH.

This endeavor holds significant implications. It aids in optimizing the ecological landscape at the regional level and fosters harmonious coexistence between humanity and the natural world. The study utilizes land-use remote sensing interpretation data from three time periods (2000, 2010, and 2020) and employs various methodologies, including equivalent factor coefficient correction, sensitivity analysis, and spatial autocorrelation. The objective is to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of land-use changes and Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) in Lanzhou City. Furthermore, geographic detectors are applied to explore the driving factors influencing ESV spatial heterogeneity and their interactions. The research findings indicate the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, grassland and cropland were the predominant land-use types in Lanzhou City, with cropland and urban land experiencing the most active changes. (2) ESV in Lanzhou City increased from 179.37 billion RMB in 2000 to 193.86 billion RMB in 2020, reflecting an ESV total growth rate of 8.07% and a gradual improvement in the ecological environment. Spatially, ESV exhibits a west high, east low distribution pattern, with the center shifting towards the northwest and southeast, gradually reducing spatial imbalance. (3) Analysis of ESV spatial autocorrelation reveals that high-high clusters are predominantly found within the Tulu Gou National Forest Park and the Xinglong Mountain National Natural Reserve, while low-low clusters are primarily concentrated in the central urban area of Lanzhou City. Over the period from 2000 to 2020, the spatial clustering effect of ESV within the study area has progressively intensified. 4)NDVI, precipitation, and GDP emerge as pivotal factors influencing spatial differentiation within Lanzhou City, with natural and societal elements exerting interactive effects on ESV spatial disparities. The research results integrate environmental considerations into the decision-making process, offering valuable insights for formulating targeted ecological protection policies in Lanzhou City. This study embodies concrete measures taken by Lanzhou City in practicing China's concept of green water and green mountains are golden silver mountains, providing a theoretical basis for the harmonious and sustainable development of the ecological economy.","[Qiao, Hongqiang; Kang, Yongwei; Niu, Yali] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Management, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China",Gansu Agricultural University,"Qiao, HQ (通讯作者)，Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Management, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",qiaohqtd@sina.com,"Li, Yuzhu/HHN-5062-2022",,Gansu Agricultural University,Gansu Agricultural University,We gratefully acknowledge Gansu Agricultural University for supporting this research.

It describes how Cerro Sapo's current owner, a white Kenyan, engaged in narrative and bodily practices that sought to detach him from earlier labor histories and Indigenous demands for redistributive aid. Through a life history approach, the analysis centers one figure to provide insight into what capitalism looks like on the ground. This case sharpens scholarly understanding of the affective workings of extraction, highlighting the need to historicize feelings of trust and accountability by dis-aggregating the figure of the mine and the firm. By illuminating Cerro Sapo's continuities with, and revisions to, colonial structures of racial violence and exchange, the article aims to advance studies of racial capitalism and add a new layer to public debates about colonial debts and reparations for slavery.

Zoonosis is now a major public health issue on a global scale because of the fast expansion of human exploitation of nature and animal husbandry. Notably, in the past 30 years, over 30 novel human infections have been discovered, 75% of which fall under the category of zoonosis. Resistant strains have emerged as a result of improper use of antibiotics and insufficient infection management posing a serious risk to both public health and the global economy. As alternatives, antimicrobial peptides are showing good results. The majority of living things use antibacterial peptides (ABPs) as a key part of their natural defenses against invading infections. These peptides are cationic, amphipathic, and relatively tiny with varied sequences, structures, and lengths. For the delivery of these efficacious biological peptides, nanoparticles are providing opportunities for effective, safe, and viable delivery. An innovative method of treating infectious diseases is demonstrated by nanoparticles and antibacterial peptides. When ABPs are combined with carrier nanoparticles to optimize distribution, their half-life may be increased, allowing for lower dosages and ultimately lower toxicity. For biological applications, ABPs and nanoparticle conjugates have become effective methods, enabling the treatment, prevention of disease, and detection. More than 50 peptide medications have been made available for purchase on the market as of 2018. Around 25 billion USD is spent on peptide medications each year, including ABPs. But still, there is a gap in the distribution of these ABPs as an alternative to synthetic antibiotics. It might be due to the high cost of these goods. Thus, scientists, researchers, and commercializing companies should work together so that these ABPs with a safe delivery system should be available in the market to combat resistant strains of bacteria. In doing so, we draw attention to the significant advancements made in the field as well as the difficulties still encountered in developing imaging species, active therapies, and nano-drug delivery systems that are functionalized with peptides and proteins for clinical use.","[Tahir, Saleha; Arshad, Muhammad Imran; Mahmood, Muhammad Shahid] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Microbiol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Abbas, Rao Zahid; Qamar, Warda; Zaheer, Tean] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Parasitol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Alvi, Mughees Aizaz] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Clin Med & Surg, Faisalabad, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Qamar, W (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Parasitol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",wardaqamar17@gmail.com,"Alvi, Dr. Mughees Aizaz/CAG-5814-2022; Mahmood, Muhammad/AAX-2529-2020; Zaheer, Tean/ABI-6123-2020; Arshad, Muhammad Imran/P-5550-2018","Arshad, Muhammad Imran/0000-0003-2218-9054",,,,,142,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1642-3402,2300-8733,,ANN ANIM SCI,Ann.

This approach is the key to analyzing the ecological resilience to drought, stress-induced mortality, and economic efficiency of managed mixed forest stands in Central Europe. The results show that specific geographic conditions and forest composition define the optimal stand density of drought-resilient forests. Context Reducing stand density has been recognized as a valid strategy to increase forest resilience to drought. Moreover, to develop adaptive management strategies (AMS) under climate change, it is crucial to consider not only drought resilience but also the economic efficiency of alternative AMS proposed to alleviate drought effects. Aims To analyze how decreased inter-tree competition among overstorey trees affects stand vulnerability to drought and its expected yield. Methods We integrated experimental thinning data and historical responses to drought years in a climate-sensitive forest gap model, ForClim. We tested a business as usual (BAU) and three alternative AMS (do-nothing, low- and high-intensity overstorey removal) in mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) along an elevational gradient of 520-1020 m a.s.l. in Central Europe. Results High-intensity overstorey removal in mixed stands of all three species considerably increased forest volume growth resilience to drought and decreased stress-induced mortality by two-thirds vis a vis a do-nothing strategy. In sites including only conifer species, forest resilience was equally improved by high- and low-intensity overstorey removal compared to that in the BAU strategy. Regarding the timber economy, high-intensity overstorey removal resulted in a higher economic revenue of mixed stands (similar to 22% higher net present value than other strategies) on the high-elevation sites (> 1000 m a.s.l.). Conclusion Modifying forest density and structure by overstorey removal is principally suitable to increase forest resilience to drought and improve its economic efficiency. The magnitude of the effect however depends on the geographical setting and forest composition.","[Zamora-Pereira, Juan Carlos; Yousefpour, Rasoul; Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Cailleret, Maxime] Univ Aix Marseille, INRAE, UMR Recover, Aix En Provence, France; [Cailleret, Maxime; Bugmann, Harald] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Forest Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cailleret, Maxime] Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","University of Freiburg; Aix-Marseille Universite; INRAE; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Zamora-Pereira, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",juan.zamora@ife.uni-freiburg.de; rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de; maxime.cailleret@inrae.fr; harald.bugmann@env.ethz.ch; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011; Bugmann, Harald/A-1252-2008; Yousefpour, Rasoul/F-1601-2017","Zamora-Pereira, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-0771-1334; Hanewinkel, Marc/0000-0003-4081-6621; Cailleret, Maxime/0000-0001-6561-1943; Bugmann, Harald/0000-0003-4233-0094",Projekt DEAL; ForRISK project (ERA-NET Sumforest); European Union [606803]; Federal Office for the Environment FOEN [05.0602.PZ/P382-0487]; French National Research Agency A.

The reactions mainly include: (1) cyclization: a) transition-metal catalyzed C-H bond activation cyclization with directing groups; b) cyclization reactions with non-directing groups; (2) hydrogenation reduction; (3) fluorination as F source reagents. In this paper, the synthesis methods and applications of difluorocyclopropenes in past 10 years are summarized. The conversion reactions of difluorocyclopropenes are emphasized. Additionally, difluorocyclopropenes have aroused considerable interests both from a structural standpoint and their participation in various ring-opening reactions. Given the increasing application of cyclopropyl skeleton in the development of drugs and unarguable importance of fluorinated compounds in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry, it is no doubt that difluorocyclopropenes are encountered into bioactive molecular and at present lie among emerging fluorinated motifs. Although the synthesis and application of structurally diverse difluorocyclopropenes have been witnessed in the past decade, the most widely used methods for the preparation of these compounds include difluoromethylenation of alkynes and difluoromethylation of heteroatom nucleo-philes (such as NaF, NaI, (BuN4X)-Bu-n, etc.) with a difluorocarbene reagent, which can be generated from various precursors (such as TMSCF3, TMSCF2X, Ph3P(+)CF(2)CO(2)(-), TFDA, etc.). For the transition metal-catalyzed cyclization of difluorocyclopropenes, some common metal salts (such as rhodium, ruthenium, copper, palladium, silver) are used as catalysts. Moreover, the metallic hydrogen (M-H) reduction strategy is a simple and efficient method for the hydrogenation reduction of difluorocyclopropenes leading to difluorocyclopropanes, and the asymmetric hydrogenation reduction of difluorocyclopropenes can be achieved in the presence of chiral ligands. In fluorination reactions, difluorocyclopropenes have some advantages that cannot be achieved by traditional fluorination reagents for the direct fluorination and functionalization of hydroxyl groups (such as fluorination of polyhydroxyl alcohols). Of course, the biggest disadvantage of difluorocyclopropene as a fluorine source lies in its poor atomic economy, which has been criticized. Despite the remarkable achievements in the reactions of difluorocyclopropenes, there are still many issues that need to be addressed. For instance, difluorocyclopropenes are rarely applied in traditional radical reactions, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and flow chemistry. Hopefully, difluorocyclopropenes can gradually appear in photo- and electro-catalyzed radical chemistry, and the related asymmetric reactions will also get more attention and development in the near future.","[Huang Jiapian; Liu Fei; Wu Jie] Taizhou Univ, Sch Pharmaceut & Chem Engn, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Huang Jiapian; Liu Fei; Wu Jie] Taizhou Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Wu Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Taizhou University; Taizhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS","Wu, J (通讯作者)，Taizhou Univ, Sch Pharmaceut & Chem Engn, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.;Wu, J (通讯作者)，Taizhou Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.;Wu, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",jie_wu@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [22171206]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [Z23B020002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),Project supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22171206) and Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (No. Z23B020002).,,112,4,4,10,41,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0567-7351,,,ACTA CHIM SINICA,Acta Chim.

J,"Poretti, P",,,,"Poretti, Pietro",,,'How much do we get?' An update on transparency of revenues from the sales of natural resources,JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Examples of mismanagement and abuse of resource revenues continue to abound in countries with huge natural resource wealth and struggling with governance. Transparency is no silver bullet but rather a key element of a growing dialogue leading to change and hopefully to better governance. Thanks to the work undertaken by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and several NGOs, the issue of transparency of revenues from the sales of natural resources, in particular crude oil, is receiving increased attention. As more information is becoming available, also through to the inclusion of this stream of revenues in EITI reports, interested parties can better grasp the economic importance of sales of resources and the many risks associated with such transactions, resulting from corruption or from inexperience and lack of skills needed to maximize profits. Currently, discussions on how to further improve data collection are being conducted under the auspices of the EITI, notably with the creation of the EITI Working Group on Commodity Trading, and benefit from the support of NGOs such as the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) and Public Eye. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also recognized that a concerted effort by producer countries, commodity trading hubs and OECD countries home to companies active in trading is necessary to tackle corruption and rent diversion and drive collective global action. National legislators so far refrained from enacting transparency regulations that would require resource purchasing companies to disclose the amounts they pay to selling governments and state-owned enterprises. Despite the failure of the United States to implement Section 1504 of the Dodd Frank Act and the withdrawal of the world's largest economy from the EITI, there are reasons to believe that the transparency trend will continue. The first trading company voluntary disclosures and tehcnological advances can contribute to more accurate data collection and corroboration. EITI has shown that it can effectively lead the way and mobilize stakeholders around the issue of transparency of revenues from the sale of resources. While the attention remains on the technical aspects of the disclosure of revenues and payments, it is important not to lose sight of the overarching goal. The impact of EITI and of any other national and international transparency initiative on the people in resource-rich countries ultimately depends on the ability of concerned citizens to interpret the information collected, and on the willingness and capacity of governments to undertake reforms which such information show to be necessary.","[Poretti, Pietro] Econ Dev, Lugano, Switzerland",,"Poretti, P (通讯作者)，Econ Dev, Lugano, Switzerland.",porettip@yahoo.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,2,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1754-9957,1754-9965,,J WORLD ENERGY LAW B,J.

Recycling is one of the environment-friendly waste management strategies that creates a net environmental gain in recovering valuable materials. In some countries, downstream recycling (high-value material recovery) is done overseas, and Australia is one of them. Waste printed circuit board (PCB) is a critical component of various electronic equipment, and it contains metals such as copper, tin, gold, aluminium, iron, silver, and others. Waste PCB, as apart of e-waste is mainly recycled overseas in Australia. However, the overall environmental impacts of recycling the waste stream overseas have yet to be investigated. The benefits of recovering the material in Australia have yet to be extensively understood from a supply chain perspective. This study aims to develop multiple scenarios using lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodology to identify the best possible solution for waste PCB disposal (final sink) derived from e-waste. Using SimaPro and Ecoinvent databases, four scenarios have been developed, along with a baseline scenario where waste PCB is recycled overseas. Receipe 2016 impact assessment methodology was utilized for the analysis, and results of the study showed that Scenario 2 (integrated material and energy recovery) is the best approach for waste PCB recycling in Australia, while landfill and direct incineration were the identified two worst scenarios in terms of final disposal option. When choosing local recycling over overseas recycling of waste PCB (material recovery only), it was found that impact categories such as global warming (human health) and fossil resource scarcity were reduced by 53% and 98%, respectively. In addition, the net positive environmental gain could be achieved for human non-carcinogenic toxicity by 7.16% when the waste stream is recycled in Australia. Uncertainty analysis of the study showed that in almost all major impact categories, material and energy recovery together scored high compared to scenarios when only material recovery was considered. This study is the first systematic attempt to characterize system-level lifecycle environmental impact assessment for waste PCB recycling. Future policies and regulations should focus on data transparency and availability across the value chain, local infrastructure development, and resource circularity. This study will add value to decision-making, policy on investment and future policy planning. It will also help industry and researchers develop optimized recycling-focused low-emission resource recovery supply chains.","[Islam, Md Tasbirul; Iyer-Raniga, Usha] RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construction & Project Management, 124 Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Islam, MT (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construction & Project Management, 124 Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",md.tasbirul.islam2@rmit.edu.au; usha.iyer-raniga@rmit.edu.au,"Islam, Md Tasbirul/AFL-3493-2022","Iyer-Raniga, Usha/0000-0002-3088-8739; Islam, Md Tasbirul/0000-0002-6323-2795",,,,,65,14,15,21,72,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Dietary supplements were repeatedly said to be unnecessary if one eats a balanced diet but within the booming silver economy, sales of vitamins, minerals and supplements totalled nearly $23 billion in the US last year (Euro monitor International). Seventy eight antioxidant supplements trials including 296 707 participants were reviewed by the Cochrane Database System Review. It was concluded that beta-carotene and vitamin E supplements, instead of promoting longevity, were increasing mortality and so may high doses of vitamin A. Several nutrition interventions with or without edible phytochemicals, fasting regimens, and food supplements have now been tried to prevent the development of many different types of tumors. Most were known as antioxidants and are now repurposed because they were shown to change the epigenome. Epigenetic marks are enzymatic tags deposited on the genome which do not change the DNA sequence but change gene expression. They are reversible and epigenetic dietary interventions are thus suggested for the prevention of ageing, ageing related diseases and for breaking the vicious circle of the trans-generational epigenetic inheritance of the metabolic disorders. It is a pressing issue because more and more children are exposed to parents' obesity and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Why is it relevant to propose epigenetic Nutricures to prevent diseases linked with ageing? To answer this question we produce this review, whose scope is to underline the importance of the nutritional contribution for a correct functioning of epigenetics. Almost all chromatin-modifying enzymes utilize co-factors, which are crucial metabolites for core metabolism pathways. Because the cellular concentrations of these metabolites fluctuate as a function of the metabolic status of the cell, the activity of most epigenetic enzymes depends on the cell metabolism and thus nutrition. Through one selected representative example, sirtuins, and their metabolic co-factor, nicotinamide, we illustrate the nutrition and epigenetic connections. Then we describe the epigenetic activities of some polyphenols. Finally we underline that with globalization there is a continuing trend changing the variety of food items that we consume. Each may have bioactive effects that may combine with additional epigenetic effects of pollutants such as pesticides. We plead likewise that because they are bioactive, Nutricures and food supplements should undergo better evaluation before marketing.","[Christodoulou, Michael.

The objective of this article is to characterize the pyrolysis khat waste in both proximate and ultimate analysis, thermal decomposition (weight loss of khat), and functional categories of khat waste, by using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to determine the functional group of a sample. We also used an elemental analyzer device (model: Thermo Scientific-EA1112 FLASH CHNS/O analyzer) to measure elemental composition, characterize the proximate analysis of khat, and measure weight loss or thermal behavior of raw khat sample by using a device called thermogravimetric analyzer (TA instrument model: SDT Q600). The determined characterization of the khat sample was 48.25 percent carbon, 6.16 percent hydrogen, 45.13 percent oxygen, and 0.46 percent nitrogen. When compared to coal, khat contains extremely little nitrogen, resulting in less environmental contamination to the air than fossil fuel combustion. The proximate analysis results of the khat sample also showed 5 percent and 5.26 percent moisture content for both wet and dry bases, respectively, as well as 76.3 percent volatile matter, 4.8 percent ash content, and 13.83 percent fixed carbon. The findings are discussed in this research by comparing the final value results with other biomass and coil. The functional group of khat waste was studied using a spectrum of (65 Perkin Elmer) at wavelength ranges of 4000 to 400 cm(-1). The weight loss of the khat sample at 700 degrees C and a heating rate of 20 degrees C/min, as well as the proximate analysis of this raw khat, were 4.5 percent, 75.84 percent, 5.38 percent, and 14.28 percent for moisture, unstable substance, ash content, and static carbon, respectively. The differences between TGA values and the projected proximal value were 10%, 0.6 percent, 9.47 percent, and 3.15 percent for moisture, volatile matter, as content, and fixed carbon, respectively. Overall, the benefit we get from pyrolysis of khat waste is that khat waste has very low nitrogen content and empty sulfur, which is very important for reducing air pollution and environmental sanitation when used as fuel. So from pyrolysis, khat waste types of fuel such as biochar, liquid fuel, and gas fuel can be obtained.","[Afessa, Geleta; Krishnaraj, Ramaswamy] Dambi Dollo Univ, Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Dambi Dollo, Ethiopia; [Saka, Abel; Tesfaye, Jule Leta] Dambi Dollo Univ, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Dept Phys, Dambi Dollo, Ethiopia; [Tesfaye, Jule Leta; Nagaprasad, N.] Ultra Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Madurai 625104, Tamil Nadu, India; [Shanmugam, R.] JSS Acad Higher Educ & Res, JSS Coll Pharm, TIFAC, CORE HD, Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India; [Dwarampudi, L.

Millions of people around the world are affected by poor wound healing, causing increased mortality rates and related costs. Immedicable wounds are a health problem because they directly affect the person's standard of living and produce an ultimatum to the health of people and the international economy because of the expensive medical treatment. Other schemes/approaches must be designed to achieve productive and therapeutic results. In this context, the emergence of Nano biotechnology may provide another manifesto to produce latest drugs for long-term treatment processes. This article shows that the implementation of metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) has unbolted a brand-new gateway in the discipline of eco-friendly medicine due to their unique properties such as medicine transportation, antimicrobial activity and quick recovery. Moreover, metal nanoparticles (NPs) manufactured by green synthesis not only add the effects of nanoparticles and plant extracts but also reduce toxicity to tissues and make their use safer. In the present work, Ag and Au nanoparticles were synthesized using an aqueous seed extract of Cichorium intybus and their wound healing ability was assessed by performing in-vivo wound healing activity on albino mice. Till now there is no study available on the in-vivo wound healing potential of Ag and Au nanoparticles using Cichorium intybus. This is the first study ever to assess the ability of Cichorium intybus seed extract and its metal nanoparticles (AgNPs & AuNPs) to promote wound healing in animals which shows its uniqueness and novelty. The results displayed augmented and quicker wound closure with Ag as compared to the Au nanoparticles, polyfax and simple plant extract in a 21-day research work. These results illustrated that eco-friendly prepared nanoparticles provide a prominent approach to fight with the bacteria resistant against combination therapy without any lethal affair. Environment-friendly NPs declared to be the low-cost best treatment for the faster recovery of wounds. The main goal of this research is to provide aid in the creation of plant-based, durable and affordable Nano medicine for wound care, lowering dependency on synthetic techniques and encouraging environmental friendly biomedical applications.","[Khalid, Amna; Khurshid, Shazia; Khan, Jahangir] Govt Coll Univ Lahore, Dept Chem, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Uroos, Maliha] Univ Punjab, Ctr Res Ion Liquids, Sch Chem, Quaid E Azam Campus, Lahore, Pakistan; [Sarwar, Abid; ul Haq, Ehsan] Pakistan Council Sci & Ind Res PCSIR, Lahore 54600, Pakistan; [Aziz, Tariq] Univ Ioannina, Dept Agr, Lab Anim Hlth Food Hyg & Qual, Arta, Greece; [Alshehri, Fatma] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biol, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Asmari, Fahad] King Faisal Univ, Coll Agr & Food Sci, Dept Food & Nutr Sci, Al Hasa 31982, Saudi Arabia; [Baothman, Bandar K.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Appl Med Sci, Dept Med Lab Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Joufi, Fakhria A.] Jouf Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacol, Aljouf 72341, Saudi Arabia; [Alwethaynani, Maher S.] Shaqra Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Clin Lab Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Government College University Lahore; University of Punjab; University of Ioannina; Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University; King Faisal University; King Abdulaziz University; Al Jouf University; Shaqra University,"Khurshid, S (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ Lahore, Dept Chem, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.;Aziz, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Agr, Lab Anim Hlth Food Hyg & Qual, Arta, Greece.",shaziakhurshid1@yahoo.com; iwockd@gmail.com,"Alshehri, Fatma/GOG-8116-2022; Aljoufi, Fakhria/AAG-9938-2021",,"Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [PNURSP2025R228]; [KFU242653]","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University);","The authors express their gratitude to Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2025R228), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In national carbon and biomass budgets, trees growing in hedgerows and tree rows are often allocated the same biomass increment data as forest-grown trees. However, the growing conditions in these linear habitats are different from forests given that the trees receive more solar radiation, potentially benefit from fertilization residuals from adjacent fields and have more physical growing space. Tree biomass increment and carbon storage in linear woody elements should therefore be quantified and correctly accounted for. We examined four different hedgerow systems with combinations of pedunculate oak, black alder and silver birch in northern Belgium. We used X-ray CT scans of pith-to-bark cores of 73 trees to model long-term (tree life span) and short-term (last five years) trends in basal area increment and increment in aboveground stem biomass. The studied hedgerows and tree rows showed high densities (168-985 trees km(-1)) and basal areas (22.1-44.9 m(2) km(-1)). In all four hedgerow systems, we found a strong and persistent increase in stem biomass and thus carbon accumulation with diameter (long-term trend). The current growth performance (short-term trend) also increased with tree diameter and was not related to hedgerow tree density or basal area, which indicates that competition for light does not (yet) limit tree growth in these ecosystems. The total stem volume was 82.0-339.7 m(3) km(-1) (corresponding to 18.8-100.7 Mg aboveground carbon km(-1)) and the stem volume increment was 3.1-14.5 m(3) km(-1) year(-1) (aboveground carbon sequestration 0.7-4.3 Mg km(-1) year(-1)). The high tree densities and the persistent increase in growth of trees growing in hedgerow systems resulted in substantial wood production and carbon sequestration rates at the landscape scale. Our findings show that trees growing in hedgerow systems should be included when biomass and carbon budgets are drafted. The biomass production rates of hedgerow trees we provide can help refine the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.","[Van den Berge, Sanne; Vangansbeke, Pieter; Baeten, Lander; Vanneste, Thomas; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [Vanhellemont, Margot] Univ Coll Ghent, Fac Sci & Technol, Brusselsesteenweg 161, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [De Mil, Tom; Van den Bulcke, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, UGCT UGent Woodlab, Lab Wood Technol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Mil, Tom] Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, 1215 E Lowell St, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [De Mil, Tom] Univ Liege, TERRA Teaching & Res Ctr, Gembloux Agro Biotech, Forest Life, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium",Ghent University; HOGENT University College of Applied Sciences & Arts; Ghent University; University of Arizona; University of Liege,"Van den Berge, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Forest & Nat Lab, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle, Belgium.",sanne.vandenberge@ugent.be,"Baeten, Lander/G-1490-2010; Vangansbeke, Pieter/AAP-6762-2021","Van Den Berge, Sanne/0000-0001-6155-7097; Baeten, Lander/0000-0003-4262-9221; Vanhellemont, Margot/0009-0001-6045-8342",Forest Microclimate Assessment (FORMICA) project (European Research Council) [757833]; Special Research Fund of Ghent University (BOF) [01N02817]; King Baudouin Foundation; Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF); European Research Council through the PASTFORWARD project [614839]; Special Research Fund of Ghent University [BOF.EXP.2017.0007],Forest Microclimate Assessment (FORMICA) project (European Research Council); Special Research Fund of Ghent University (BOF)(Ghent University); King Baudouin Foundation; Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF); European Research Council through the PASTFORWARD project(European Research Council (ERC)); Special Research Fund of Ghent University(Ghent University),We thank Kris Ceunen and Jonathan Janssens for their help during the fieldwork and Stijn Willen for his help preparing the samples to examine with the LINTAB table.

In recent years, climate change has led to drought and severe bark beetle infestations, affecting Norway spruce (Picea abies) across Europe, with detrimental consequences for forest owners, the forestry sector and associated industries. As a result, silviculture now faces the challenge of identifying tree species more resilient to these stressors to mitigate the impacts on forest management, forest-dependent economies and rural livelihoods. The North American Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) has emerged as a promising conifer species, better suited to future climate conditions and capable of producing high timber yields. 2. Non-native tree species may affect native biodiversity, yet the impacts of Douglas-fir on native forest biodiversity are not clear. A comprehensive review evaluating the impact of Douglas-fir on faunal and floral biodiversity in European forests is lacking. 3. Here, we present the results of a systematic literature review on Douglas-fir effects on native biodiversity, focusing on studies conducted in Europe. For arthropods, sufficient studies were found to do more detailed quantitative assessments. For fungi, birds, plants and soil fauna some studies existed, but only qualitative evaluations could be made. Other taxa were not investigated. 4. In the present literature, the effects of Douglas-fir inclusion in stands on native biodiversity, compared to stands of solely native tree species, were mostly non-significant (78.6%, based on 32 studies). Positive effects were noted in 12% of cases, while negative effects were observed in 9.4% (total of 1,936 effects). Above-ground fauna was more extensively studied than below-ground fauna. Mechanisms proposed to explain taxa responses were often discussed but not always formally tested. For arthropods, there were varying effects on diversity between studies evaluating different scales (i.e., tree-scale vs. stand-scale). In general, differences in effects depended on a range of factors, including stand composition and structure, season, and sampling site and period. 5. Our review indicates limited evidence of adverse effects of Douglas-fir on biodiversity in European forests, highlighting a significant knowledge gap due to the scarcity of studies. Douglas-fir's impact on biodiversity likely varies depending on the forest type and management practices. Further research in diverse contexts is crucial to determine optimal levels of admixture and guide forest management.","[Graf, Marlene; Achury, Rafael; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Dept Life Sci Syst, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Lanzrein, Isabelle; Annighoefer, Peter] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Forest & Agroforest Syst, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Wenglein, Ronja; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Anim Ecol, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Scheu, Stefan] Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Gottingen,"Graf, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Dept Life Sci Syst, Terr Ecol Res Grp, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",marlene.graf@tum.de,"Achury, Rafael/AAQ-7157-2020; Weisser, Wolfgang/B-9718-2014; Annighöfer, Peter/AAS-8418-2021","Achury, Rafael/0000-0003-0435-3594","Bavarian State Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry [klifW018]","Bavarian State Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry","Funding This study was supported by grant klifW018 of the Bavarian State Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry for funding.

At present, the popular thermal treatment would cause serious ECs damage and toxic gas leakage. In the chemical method, ECs can be dismantled by dissolving the tin solders without toxic gas leakage. But there is difficulty in choosing right chemical reagent to avoid discharge of wastewater, which obstructs its industrial application in recycling waste printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs). In this article, ECs were dismantled by a mixture solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and fluoboric acid (HBF4), dissolving the tin solders on waste PCBAs. It was found that the tin solders were mildly dissolved at room temperature, and most of the ECs were preserved completely. Moreover, the mixture solution can be recycled to dissolve the tin solders repeatedly by supplementing H2O2, which avoided second pollution of fluoride wastewater discharge. So it is necessary to investigate the cyclic reaction mechanism of dissolving tin solders on waste PCBAs by a solder wire simulation system. It was observed that oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the solution changed regularly, and precipitate of copper corresponded to dissolution of tin with addition of H2O2. This is because copper, tin, and lead formed a microcorrosion cell, which promoted dissolution of solder wire effectively. And the ORP value can be used as an indication point for addition of H2O2 to recycle the mixture solution. The dissolution process was analyzed by mass distributions of tin, lead, and Cu in the solder wires, precipitate and solution, the E-pH diagram of Sn-H2O system, and the X-ray diffraction of precipitate. It was found that excessive amounts of H2O2 caused Sn2+ to form SnO passivation film at the beginning of the reaction. With decrease of pH value and oxidation degree, most of the tin formed SnO2 precipitate and lead formed Pb(BF4)(2) in solution. SnO2 and PbO can be calcined to regenerate into SnO2 and PbO metallic oxide raw materials. The process provides an environmentally friendly method for industrial applications of recovering ECs, realizes reduction and reuse of WPCBs, and can further recycle Sn and Pb. It reflects the concept of circular economy and sustainable development.","[Ping, Zhu; Liu, Xiankai; Ma, Yi; Wang, Yangjun; Li, Zuliang; Wang, Jingpei; Hao, Ying; Qian, Guangren] Shanghai Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Ping, Zhu] Shangluo Univ, Shaanxi Key Lab Comprehens Utilizat Tailings Reso, Shangluo, Peoples R China; [Ping, Zhu; Tao, Qi] Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mineral Phys & Mat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cao, Zhenbang] Univ New South Wales, Sch Chem Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Shanghai University; Shangluo University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Wang, YJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.",yjwang326@shu.edu.cn,"TAO, Qi/D-7385-2011; liu, xiankai/HZJ-3228-2023","Cao, Zhenbang/0000-0001-9315-8904","Program of Innovative Research Team in University [IRT13078]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2017B030314175]; Research Fund of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Tailings Resources (Shangluo University); Funds of Jiahua Science and Technology Bureau [2013-3-001]; Jinhua Environmental Protection Bureau [YG2014-FW673-ZFCG046]","Program of Innovative Research Team in University; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China; Research Fund of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Tailings Resources (Shangluo University); Funds of Jiahua Science and Technology Bureau; Jinhua Environmental Protection Bureau","The authors are grateful for support of Program of Innovative Research Team in University (IRT13078), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (2017B030314175), the Research Fund of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Comprehensive Utilization of Tailings Resources (Shangluo University), the Funds of Jiahua Science and Technology Bureau (Grant No. 2013-3-001), and the Funds of Jinhua Environmental Protection Bureau (Grant No. YG2014-FW673-ZFCG046).",,31,5,6,0,41,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1092-8758,1557-9018,,ENVIRON ENG SCI,Environ.

This reality urgently calls for the design and adoption of affordable, effective, and massive strategies of recycling and reutilisation of all PV components, and particularly of those most energy -demanding in their manufacturing and thus responsible for the largest quote of environmental impact: the solar cells. This work explores two key processes for the recycling of silicon solar cells, namely the recovery of the metal contacts and the recrystallisation of the silicon substrate. On the one hand, the demetallisation of first -generation solar cells in KOH-ethanol-water solutions is explored. A 2 3 factorial design of experiments was developed to optimize the process, indicating that the temperature of the bath is the most influential variable. With 10 % KOH, 5 % ethanol and 60 degrees C for 105 min, or alternatively, 15 % KOH, 5 % ethanol and 65 degrees C for 60 min, it was possible to completely detach the metal front (mainly Ag) and back contacts (mainly Ag and Al) with an overall silicon weight loss of only 13 and 15 %, respectively, with resulting carrier lifetimes in the remaining silicon matrix above 100 mu s, high enough for new solar cell fabrication targeting efficiencies exceeding 20 %. Additionally, Czochralski recrystallisation of old multicrystalline wafers has been tested to evaluate the possibility of reinjecting recovered silicon at an earlier stage of the PV value chain. After successful growth and slicing in wafers, a thorough optoelectronic characterisation program has been implemented, demonstrating the fulfilment of the basic requirements needed to make new solar cells, in terms of wafer resistivity (-1 Omega cm), oxygen content (-10 18 cm -3 ), mobility (-1000 cm 2 /V & sdot; s) and carrier lifetimes (above 100 mu s threshold in all cases and reaching maximum values of 350 mu s). Demetallised samples and recrystallised wafers are subsequently used to manufacture P/Al solar cells, and results show that the solar cell performance is not limited by the material quality. The recovery and reutilisation of the two most valuable elements of Si -based PV -modules, namely the precious metals and the ultrapurified silicon, key for the establishment of PV as an example of circular economy, are thus demonstrated.","[Tierno, Marcos; Taboada, Sergio; Diez, Eduardo; Rodriguez, Araceli] Univ Complutense Madrid, Chem & Mat Engn Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz, Julia Hernandez; Caballero, Luis Jaime; Villanueva, Nerea Dasilva; Marron, David Fuertes; del Canizo, Carlos] Univ Politecn Madrid, Inst Energia Solar ETSI Telecomunicac, Madrid, Spain; [Abrosimov, Nikolay V.] Leibniz Inst Kristallzuchtung IKZ, Berlin, Germany",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Kristallzuchtung (IKZ),"del Cañizo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Madrid, Inst Energia Solar ETSI Telecomunicac, Madrid, Spain.",,"del Cañizo, Carlos/J-8485-2012; Rodriguez, Araceli/Y-5635-2019; Marron, David/AFK-3039-2022; Diez, Eduardo/E-3711-2012; Rodriguez, Araceli/B-9862-2011","Diez, Eduardo/0000-0001-9796-396X; Rodriguez, Araceli/0000-0003-3661-5798","Spanish International Research Agency MCIN/AEI [TED2021-129624B-C41, TED2021-129624B-C42]; NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Economy; [CT36/22-32-UCM-INV]",Spanish International Research Agency MCIN/AEI; NextGenerationEU/PRTR; Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Economy;,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Grants No. TED2021-129624B-C41 and TED2021-129624B-C42 funded by the Spanish International Research Agency MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by NextGenerationEU/PRTR, and from CT36/22-32-UCM-INV, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Economy.",,47,2,2,7,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-092X,1471-1257,,SOL ENERGY,Sol.

In particular, they play a key role in low-voltage switches, which are vital in the global electrical economy. To date, substituting the toxic Ag/CdO ECMs has become a bottleneck in the development of low-voltage switches. Over the past decades, Ag/SnO2, Ag/ZnO, Ag/Ni, and Ag/C have been exploited as substitutes for Ag/CdO ECMs, but their intrinsic defects make them unsuitable; therefore, there is still an urgent need to develop eco-friendly substitutes for CdO. Recently, MAX-phase materials, which combine attractively dual metal and ceramic properties, have shown potential in replacing CdO as a reinforcement for Ag-matrix composites. Moreover, arc erosion is a common cause of the premature failure of low-voltage switches in applications. To aid the further development of MAX-reinforced Ag-matrix-composite contacts, there is a need to understand the mechanism of arc erosion and degradation of the microstructural and mechanical properties of the composites. Nano-indentation is the most common and stable method of evaluating the micromechanical properties of materials. In this study, micro-/nano-indentation tests were performed along the cross-section of Ag/Ti2SnC contacts (from the arc erosion layer to the near arc erosion layer and then to the matrix interior). The gradient variation of the microhardness, nanohardness, modulus, creep behavior, and plastic/elastic depth in different areas was analyzed and contrasted in the direction of the electrical arc erosion. The micromorphology and elemental composition were comprehensively analyzed, and the structural and compositional evolution of the Ti2SnC reinforcement phase and Ag matrix were investigated. The relationship between the gradient structural change and micro-/nano-mechanical properties of the Ag/Ti2SnC composites was analyzed. COMSOL simulations were employed to further demonstrate the physical characteristics of multi-field coupled erosion in the Ag/Ti2SnC composites; based on these analyses, we propose an erosion mechanism for the composites. This study not only provides insights into the intrinsic relationship between the structure and properties of Ag/MAX composites under arc erosion but also paves the way for the future design and development of eco-friendly contact materials for low-voltage switches.","[Ding, Kuankuan; Ding, Jianxiang; Zhang, Kaige; Sun, Zhengming] Anhui Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Maanshan 243002, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jianxiang; Zhang, Peigen; Sun, Zhengming] Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Adv Met Mat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Bai, Zhongchen] Guizhou Univ, Guizhou Prov Key Lab Photoelect Technol & Applicat, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Technology; Southeast University - China; Guizhou University,"Ding, JX (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Maanshan 243002, Peoples R China.;Ding, JX (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Adv Met Mat, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",jxding@ahut.edu.cn; zhpeigen@seu.edu.cn,"zhongchen, bai/Q-1735-2015; Ding, Jianxiang/JKH-8954-2023; Zhang, Peigen/AFC-5578-2022","Ding, Jianxiang/0000-0001-7365-373X",,,,,43,4,4,11,11,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0412-1961,,,ACTA METALL SIN,Acta Metall.

To feed the exploding population of the world, there has been a quantum jump in the production of agricultural commodities, which has led to the production of a substantial considerable quantity of agricultural and agro-industrial wastes. The bulks of these wastes are lignocellulosic in nature and consist of three main polymeric constituents, i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are recalcitrant. The primary significant portions of these remain unutilized and are burnt in the field, leading to severe environmental aggression and wastage of resource. Farmers across the globe, including India, burn these agricultural wastes in their thousands of acre land, which contribute to spoiling the air quality index (AQI). This is very harmful, especially to children, pregnant women, old adults, and for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. The current manuscript sets up an agro-waste management platform by using paddy straw as a substrate for the production of nutritionally and medically rich oyster mushroom, Pleurotus florida (Pf) and which is further used in the green synthesis of bimetallic (gold-platinum) Au-Pt nanoparticle. Yield performance and biological efficiency of Pf were calculated from the degraded paddy straw. The green synthesized Au-Pt NPs were structurally characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and zeta potential analysis. The prepared NPs showed a face-centered cubic crystal structure, icosahedral shape with a mean particle size of 16 nm. Furthermore, we examined the cytotoxic activity of Au-Pt NPs using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis by propidium iodide assay. We found that Au-Pt NPs exerted apoptotic activity on the human colon cancer cell line (HCT 116) in a dose-dependent manner from 12.5 to 200 mu g/mL. Overall, our findings create a prototype and open a new door to synthesizing functional nanoparticle by using oyster mushroom as the substrate for paddy straw agro-waste management and the applicability of Pf in the synthesis of eco-friendly Au-Pt NPs. This is the first kind of approach that kills two birds with one stone.","[Chaturvedi, Vivek K.; Rai, Sachchida Nand; Singh, Mohan P.] Univ Allahabad, Inst Interdisciplinary Sci IIDS, Ctr Biotechnol, Prayagraj 211002, India; [Yadav, Navneet] Univ Allahabad, Dept Phys, Prayagraj 211002, India; [Rai, Neeraj K.] Cent Univ South Bihar, Dept Biotechnol, Gaya 824236, India; [Bohara, Raghvendra A.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, SFI Res Ctr Med Devices, CURAM, Galway, Ireland; [Bohara, Raghvendra A.] DY Patil Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India; [Aleya, Lotfi] Chronoenvironm, Besancon, France",University of Allahabad; University of Allahabad; Central University of South Bihar; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Singh, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Allahabad, Inst Interdisciplinary Sci IIDS, Ctr Biotechnol, Prayagraj 211002, India.;Bohara, RA (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, SFI Res Ctr Med Devices, CURAM, Galway, Ireland.;Bohara, RA (通讯作者)，DY Patil Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India.",raghvendrabohara@gmail.com; mpsingh.16@gmail.com,"A.Bohara, Raghvendra/AAW-2272-2020; Chaturvedi, Vivek/P-9066-2018; Rai, Neeraj/AFS-6177-2022; Singh, Mohan/F-7059-2011; Rai, Sachchida Nand/K-5764-2019","Chaturvedi, Vivek K/0000-0002-0052-0933; RAI, NEERAJ/0000-0002-7065-7767; Singh, Mohan/0000-0002-6236-856X; Rai, Sachchida Nand/0000-0001-8418-9549",UGC [F.4-2/2006 (BSR)/BL/19-20/0032]; Irish Research Council under the Government of Ireland [GOIPD/2017/1283]; Irish Research Council (IRC) [GOIPD/2017/1283] Funding Source: Irish Research Council (IRC),"UGC(University Grants Commission, India); Irish Research Council under the Government of Ireland(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",SNR acknowledge UGC for awarding Dr. D.S.

To potential financiers, this style of mineralization is viewed as high risk because of the often relatively small resource involved and high cost of estimation. In many cases diamond core drilling will not enable resource estimation beyond the inferred and indicated categories. Exploratory underground development is required to define measured resources. The definition of geological and grade continuity are major factors in narrow vein assessment. A measured resource must be based on strong geological and grade continuities. Narrow veins, generally less than 3 m wide, are complex geological phenomena, which commonly display unpredictable geometry and grade distribution. Variations in structural continuity, dip, strike, width, mineralogy and specific gravity are common. Veins may be composite, with ore-grade mineralization restricted to a specific structural domain. Branches, intersections and braided zones are common features. Potentially high-grade zones are often localized within ore shoots, which are surrounded by barren/low-grade regions. Resources must be determined as closely as possible to reality and reflect the distribution of the commodity in the rock. Estimation has three main requirements: (1) geological study to determine orebody nature; (2) estimation of tonnage and grade, and (3) the presentation of this information using a classification that is clear, unambiguous and bankable. Estimation methods employed are either classical or geostatistical; however, classical methods are often used because of the difficulties in applying geostatistics. Grades generally show a strong positively skewed distribution testifying the presence of high-grade values. Problems exist in the applicability of cutting outlier values risking over- or underestimation of grade. It is generally believed that where resource estimates are in error, poor geological control is usually the cause. Overestimation can lead to the closure of a mine through lost revenue and capital. An understated estimate can result in an opportunity missed for profit and/or greater economies of scale. Definition of reserves involves the consideration of economic and engineering data, to decide which part of the resource is economically mineable. Geology plays a similarly important role at this stage in the assessment of likely mining method, dilution, recovery etc. Throughout resource/reserve estimation, it is crucial that the amount and quality of the data and the geologist's experience are relevant. The impact of geological understandings on estimation is often undervalued or assumed to be of lesser importance than finding grades and tonnages. This paper discusses the geology of narrow vein deposits and the importance of geology in their evaluation. (C) 1999 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.

Several studies have highlighted the relevance of electrification under deep decarbonisation. However, previous work does not explore what would be the major shifts towards electrification, i.e., in what economic activities it will likely occur and when up to 2050 considering gradually stricter GHG emissions constraints. This is of upmost relevance since relatively small variations in emission caps may trigger substantial modifications in specific components of the energy system, namely the shift for the electrification of a particular energy end-use, with impacts on the power sector's portfolio. In this paper, we analyse the extension of the electrification of the energy system as a cost-effective strategy for deep decarbonisation. We set a large number of increasingly stringent mitigation caps to assess: (i) the degree of electrification of different energy end-uses across all economic activities, (ii) the impact in power sector portfolio and costs and (iii) investment needs. The novelty of this paper relies on the anticipation of electrification of activities traditionally supplied by non-electricity energy carriers, by exploring when and how such transformation may occur in the future, and how much it would cost. We assess the case of Portugal till 2050 by using the TIMES_PT model to generate 50 increasingly stricter decarbonisation scenarios. In the long term, incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets (beyond -70% reduction) induce substantial increase in the share of electrification growth rates. Electric private vehicles, electricity-based steam and heat production in ceramic industrial sector and heat pumps in buildings are the most cost-effective electric technologies. We found that a decarbonisation up to near -80% of 1990's levels of the Portuguese energy system does not have a significant impact on the power sector unit costs, and does not surpass historic values for some years. However, it should be noted that incremental changes (+1%) in more aggressive decarbonisation targets may increase sharply electricity costs in 2050 (+ 9%). Thus, focusing in only few scenarios may narrow the role of electrification (or other mitigation options) and its associated costs for deep decarbonisation. This paper allows researchers, planners and decision makers to enhance awareness regarding the relevance and cost-effectiveness of electrification under decarbonisation, namely its feasibility and affordability, providing fruitful insights.","[Fortes, Patricia; Simoes, Sofia G.; Gouveia, Joao Pedro; Seixas, Julia] NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Fortes, P (通讯作者)，NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, CENSE Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Lisbon, Portugal.",p.fs@fct.unl.pt,"Seixas, Julia/K-9400-2013; Simoes, Sofia/I-3367-2015; Gouveia, Joao Pedro/I-4288-2014; Fortes, Patricia/K-6806-2014","Simoes, Sofia/0000-0003-4304-1411; Gouveia, Joao Pedro/0000-0002-7360-1363; Seixas, Julia/0000-0003-0355-0465; Fortes, Patricia/0000-0002-4743-1874",Portuguese Science Foundation under Post-doctoral research fellowship of Patricia Fortes [SFRH/BPD/100724/2014]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/100724/2014] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Science Foundation under Post-doctoral research fellowship of Patricia Fortes; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The authors acknowledge funding provided by the Portuguese Science Foundation under Post-doctoral research fellowship of Patricia Fortes (SFRH/BPD/100724/2014).

Recent data show that sludge reuse in agriculture has the highest share of all utilization routes in the EU. Council Directive 86/278/EEC on the spreading of sludge in agriculture, adopted more than 35 years ago, is still relevant, notwithstanding the discussion on the need to update it. Extracting critical, strategic, and precious metals and metalloids from sludge is an alternative for sludge reuse, which offers several benefits, such as avoiding the high environmental and health risks associated with using sludge directly in agriculture. Additionally, it allows for the recovery of metals, including those listed as Critical Raw Materials by the European Commission. To implement this alternative, it is necessary to first assess the metal content in the sludge and then develop economically and technically viable technologies. In this study, the content of chemical elements in the sludge of eight full-scale WWTPs in Bulgaria is analysed with focus on: (1) assessing the suitability for agricultural application by evaluating the content of macro- and micronutrients and hazardous metals; (2) assessing the possibility of using the sludge as a source of critical and precious metals.ResultsFor the main nutrients, the following contents as a percentage of the sludge dry weight (DW) were recorded-2.06% to 6% for N, 1.52% to 2.67% for P and 0.47% to 0.81% for K, which are in line with case studies of successful sludge application in agriculture. Only sludge samples from two WWTPs exceeded the permitted limit for hazardous metals and metalloids. On the other hand, of the 21 metal and metalloid constituents listed in the EU Critical and Strategic Material (CRM) list, at least one of the examined samples has a content above 10 mg/kg for 15 elements. The average contents in mg/kgDW of Au (1.1), Al (19,272.9), Mg (6677.6), Ti (1730.9), Ga (20.9) and As (16.6) measured in the investigated WWTPs are among the highest or second highest reported in other countries.ConclusionsThe results of the study show prospects for optimising and improving the reuse of sewage sludge in Bulgaria. Sewage sludge from most WWTPs has potential for agricultural application due to its high nutrient content. Large amounts of accumulated critical and strategic metals, gold and silver are trapped in Bulgarian sewage sludge, indicating that sewage sludge could be considered an alternative source with high potential for these valuable elements.","[Valchev, Dobril; Ribarova, Irina; Borisov, Boyan; Radovanov, Viden; Kostova, Irina; Dimova, Galina; Karpuzova, Orhideya; Lazarova, Svetlana] Univ Architecture, Fac Hydraul Engn, Dept Water Supply, 1 Hristo Smirnenski Blvd, Sofia 1046, Bulgaria; [Lyubomirova, Valentina] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Chem & Pharm, Dept Analyt Chem, Trace Anal Lab, 1 James Bourchier Blvd, Sofia 1164, Bulgaria",University of Architecture & Civil Engineering - Bulgaria; University of Sofia,"Valchev, D (通讯作者)，Univ Architecture, Fac Hydraul Engn, Dept Water Supply, 1 Hristo Smirnenski Blvd, Sofia 1046, Bulgaria.",dobril.valchev@gmail.com,"Valchev, Dobril/GPS-4859-2022; Lyubomirova, Valentina/AAD-1297-2019; Ribarova, Irina/JCD-9967-2023","Dimova - Boykinova, Galina/0000-0002-5492-7800","Project Clean Circle Project BG05M2OP001-1.002-0019: ,,Clean technologies for sustainable environment - waters, waste, energy for circular economy, funded by the Operational Programme Science and education for smart growth 2014-2020, co-financed by th [BG05M2OP001-1.002-0019]; Operational Programme Science and education for smart growth - European union; Center for Research and Design at the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, Sofia, Bulgaria; Water Operators of the investigated WWTPs in Bulgaria","Project Clean Circle Project BG05M2OP001-1.002-0019: ,,Clean technologies for sustainable environment - waters, waste, energy for circular economy, funded by the Operational Programme Science and education for smart growth 2014-2020, co-financed by th; Operational Programme Science and education for smart growth - European union; Center for Research and Design at the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, Sofia, Bulgaria; Water Operators of the investigated WWTPs in Bulgaria","The research presented in the paper was carried out in the framework of Project Clean & Circle Project BG05M2OP001-1.002-0019: Clean technologies for sustainable environment - waters, waste, energy for circular economy, funded by the Operational Programme Science and education for smart growth 2014-2020, co-financed by the European union through the European structural and investment funds.

Direct transformations of inert C-H bonds undoubtedly provide powerful ways to construct various C-C and C -X (X = heteroatom) bonds, with enhanced atom- and step-economy. Impressive efforts have been devoted to this research all along. However, concerns about reactivity and selectivity remain to be tackled, due to their strong dependence on directing groups and acidic reactive sites. In this regard, more effective catalytic systems are of great importance and therefore in high demand. Bimetallic C-H activation, by virtue of the cooperative effect, has emerged as a promising solution to this issue. The intriguing interactions between two metals with substrates afford exceptional reaction efficiency and selectivity. Intensive interest in both experimental and computational studies has been recently triggered. In this minireview, diverse bimetallic catalytic reactions are summarized into three categories according to the initiator in the C-H activation step, namely, bimetallic catalyses based on palladium, nickel, and other metals. Experimental results as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations are invoked in the plausible mechanistic considerations. In the first part, collaborative modes based on palladium are described, in which magnesium, chromium, cobalt, and silver are successfully engaged as accessory partners. Most of them stabilize the C-H activation transition states by decreasing the energy, thus facilitating the cleavage of C-H bonds. Notably, some reactions previously reported as examples of monomeric palladium catalysis are now reinvestigated as bimetallic scenarios, in light of computational discussions. In the second part, reactions based on the synergy of nickel, and zinc or aluminum, are generalized, in which zinc or aluminum acts as a Lewis acid to increase the acidity of C-H bonds. It has been shown that the choice of different kinds of Lewis acids and ligands has a great influence on the reaction chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. Gratefully, even enantioselective transformations can be achieved using the cooperation of nickel and aluminum. Moreover, a key reaction intermediate in the bimetallic C-H activation by nickel and aluminum has been isolated, providing guidance for this bimetallic catalytic system in further mechanistic studies and applications. In the last part, synergetic catalysis based on various other metals is presented. Bimetallic regimes of ruthenium/copper, rhodium/bismuth, iridium/aluminum, manganese/zinc, and zirconium/aluminum have been elegantly applied to C-H activation reactions. Multifarious action modes are proposed on account of the mechanistic research.","[Hu Yuanyuan; Wang Congyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Chem, CAS Res Educ Ctr Excellence Mol Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci,CAS Key Lab Mol Recognit, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Hu Yuanyuan; Wang Congyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, CY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Chem, CAS Res Educ Ctr Excellence Mol Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci,CAS Key Lab Mol Recognit, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Wang, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",wangcy@iccas.ac.cn,"Wang, Congyang/J-6603-2012; hu, yuan/HTL-4197-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [21472194, 21772202, 21521002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21472194, 21772202, 21521002).",,93,16,16,11,155,PEKING UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"PEKING UNIV, CHEMISTRY BUILDING, BEIJING 100871, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-6818,,,ACTA PHYS-CHIM SIN,Acta Phys.-Chim.

They contain a number of trace elements which are not recovered during the ore processing. Only Cu, Ag, Pb, Ni, Re, Se, Au, and PGE are extracted from Cu-Ag deposits while Zn and Pb are the only elements produced from Zn-Pb deposits. Zn-Pb deposits contain Cd, Ag, Ga, and Ba in slightly elevated concentrations and have potential to be mineral resources. This applies to a lesser extent to other trace elements (Bi, As, Hf, Tl, Sb, Se, and Re). However, only Cd and Ag show high enrichment factors indicative of potential for recovery. The bulk-rock analyses reveal strong correlations between Zn and Cd and Se, As and Mo, and weaker correlations between Ag and Cd, as well as Ga and Zn. Electron microprobe analyses of sphalerite revealed high concentrations of Cd (<= 2.6 wt%) and Ag (<= 3300 ppm). Zn-Pb deposits have fairly significant estimated resources of Ga and Sc (>1000 tons) and Cd (>10,000 tons). The Cu-Ag deposits have element signatures characterized by high values of Co, V, Ni, and Mo and much lower of Bi, As, Cd, Hg, Mo, Sb, and Tl. Bulk-rock analyses show strong correlations between Se and V; As and Co; Bi and Re; and weaker correlations between, for example, Cu and Mo; V, Ni, Ag and Mo; and Ni, V, and Co and Ni. The EPMA determinations reveal strong enrichments of Ag in Cu sulfides (geerite <= 10.1 wt %, chalcocite <= 6.28 wt %, bornite <= 3.29 wt %, djurleite <= 9080 ppm, yarrowite <= 6614 ppm, and digenite <= 3545 ppm). Silver minerals and alloys, as well as the native Ag and Au, were recorded in the Cu-Ag ores. Large resources of Co, V, and Ni (>100,000 tons) and Sc and Mo (>10,000 tons) are notable in Cu-Ag deposits. A number of trace elements, classified as critical for the economy of the European Union, including Ga and Ba (to a lesser extent Hf, Nb, and Sc) in Zn-Pb deposits, and Co and V in the Cu-Ag deposits, may eventually be recovered in the future from the studied deposits if proper ore-processing circuits and increasing demand are favorable.","[Mikulski, Stanislaw Z.; Oszczepalski, Slawomir; Sadlowska, Katarzyna; Chmielewski, Andrzej; Malek, Rafal] Polish Geol Inst, Natl Res Inst, Rakowiecka 4, PL-00975 Warsaw, Poland",Polish Geological Institute - National Research Institute,"Mikulski, SZ (通讯作者)，Polish Geol Inst, Natl Res Inst, Rakowiecka 4, PL-00975 Warsaw, Poland.",stanislaw.mikulski@pgi.gov.pl; slawomir.oszczepalski@pgi.gov.pl; katarzyna.sadlowska@pgi.gov.pl; andrzej.chmielewski@pgi.gov.pl; rafal.malek@pgi.gov.pl,"Mikulski, Stanislaw/AAC-7020-2020; Oszczepalski, Slawomir/S-5816-2016","Oszczepalski, Slawomir/0000-0002-1965-0594; MIKULSKI, STANISLAW/0000-0002-9941-5630; Chmielewski, Andrzej/0000-0002-1723-1273; Malek, Rafal/0000-0003-3163-2433",Polish Geological Institute-National Research Institute [62.9012.1983.00.0]; National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management [506/2015]; FRAME (Forecasting and Assessing Europe's Strategic Raw Materials Needs) project within the GeoERA grant [731166 H2020],Polish Geological Institute-National Research Institute; National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management; FRAME (Forecasting and Assessing Europe's Strategic Raw Materials Needs) project within the GeoERA grant,"This work is financially supported by the Polish Geological Institute-National Research Institute through an internal grant for publication no. 62.9012.1983.00.0 and by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management in accordance with agreement no. 506/2015 for S.M., as well as by the FRAME (Forecasting and Assessing Europe's Strategic Raw Materials Needs) project within the GeoERA grant (number 731166 H2020).",,101,28,29,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,JAN,2020,10,1,,,,,,,75,10.3390/min10010075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min10010075,,,47,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,KY3DW,,gold,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000522452300075,View Full Record in Web of Science

The reserves of dispersed metals are relatively rare and the distribution is extremely uneven. Additionally, the contradiction between supply and demand is growing, and there is a high supply risk. On the other hand, its characteristics of dispersed , companion and fine result in the weakness of understanding of its geochemical properties and behavior, and the mechanism of element supernormal enrichment remains controversial. In the past 20 years, the study on dispersed metals has been focused on the types, metallogenic specialization, reservation assessment, and super-enrichment mechanisms. It has changed the conception that  dispersed metals cannot form independent deposits and initially established the metallogenic regulation of dispersed metals. Super-enrichment of dispersed elements often requires extremely rigid conditions and special geochemical processes. The super-enrichment of rhenium is restricted by mantle melting process, ocean crust sediment recycling, magma oxygen fugacity and degassing process. Indium and tin are often closely related, and both the volatile components and the crystallization process of Fe-Mg silicate minerals in magma that have control the amount of indium in the ore-forming hydrothermal fluid. The mantle source, high oxygen fugacity and high volatility of alkaline rocks promote the migration and enrichment of tellurium, and delta-MnO2 or FeOOH can adsorb large amounts of tellurium in ferromanganese crust. The super-accumulation behavior of cadmium is mainly related to zinc, and the degree of cadmium enrichment is depend on the types of lead-zinc deposits. Germanium in lead-zinc deposits mainly substitute to zinc in sphalerite by isomorphous processes, and tends to combine with organic matter to form germanium complexes and organism in coal seams. Based on current studies, it is necessary to strengthen the investigations concerning the control of element geochemical behavior on the enrichment of dispersed metals, the coupling mechanism among the crust-mantle interaction, hydrothermal process, supergene weathering and deposition, and multistage geological events, and the study on the metallogenic potential of unconventional dispersed metal deposits. This special issue reports the latest progress about this aspect in 13 papers that deal dominantly with magmatic hydrothermal deposit, low-temperature hydrothermal lead-zinc deposit, epigenetic weathering and sedimentation processes of the super-enrichment of dispersed metals, as well as the exploration technology and the prediction method of dispersed metal deposits.","[Wen HanJie; Zhu ChuanWei; Luo ChongGuang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Ore Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Wen HanJie; Li XiaoFeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou ZhengBing; Wang DaZhao; Du ShengJiang] East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li XiaoFeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Mineral Resources, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen MaoHong] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Mineral Resources, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China; [Li HongYi] China Univ Geosci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geochemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; East China University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geology & Geophysics, CAS; China Geological Survey; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences; China University of Geosciences","Wen, HJ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Ore Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Guizhou, Peoples R China.;Wen, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",wenhanjie@vip.gyig.ac.cn,"li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; Wang, Dazhao/MZQ-5008-2025; Chen, maohong/KYO-8345-2024",,,,,,213,32,71,6,77,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-0569,2095-8927,,ACTA PETROL SIN,Acta Petrol.

Traditional methods for the treatment of oily wastewater include centrifugation, skimming, flotation, oil-absorbing technology, etc., which are limited by low separation efficiency as well as secondary pollution during the post-processing of oil absorption materials. Recently, separation technologies utilizing the special wettabilities of filtration membranes have been developed to enrich and recycle oils from wastewater. Among these, the fabrication of superhydrophilic/underwater superhydrophobic membranes have attracted intensive research interest, which can selectively allow the passage of water through the membrane while blocking the oils. However, microorganisms are more likely to breed on these hydrophilic surfaces, eventually leading to the blockage of the membranes. In this study, ZSM-5 zeolite crystals (MFI topological structure) were coated onto the stainless-steel meshes by means of seeding and secondary hydrothermal growth. Then, 70% of the total Na+ ions in the zeolite channels were substituted by Ag+ ions via an ion exchange process. The resultant membranes (Ag@ZCMFs) were superamphiphilic in air, with both water contact angle and oil contact angle of approximately 0 degrees. However, they became superoleophobic when immersed in water, and the underwater oil contact angle reached 151.27 degrees +/- 4.34 degrees. In terms of special wettability, Ag@ZCMF achieved efficient separation for various oil-water mixtures with separation efficiencies above 99%. The water flux and intrusion pressure of Ag@ZCMF depended on the diameter of pinholes in the membrane, which could be modulated by altering the time of secondary hydrothermal growth. For instance, the average diameter of pinholes in Ag@ZCMF with optimum secondary growth time of 14 h (Ag@ZCMF-14) reached approximately 21 mu m, giving rise to the water flux and intrusion pressure of 54720 L.m(-2).h(-1) and 4357 Pa, respectively. The anti-corrosion test and rubbing test confirmed the high chemical and mechanical stability of Ag@ZCMF-14, respectively. The separation efficiency of Ag@ZCMF-14 remained stable during ten purification-regeneration cycles, and no obvious attenuation was observed, proving the high separation stability of Ag@ZCMF-14. Furthermore, the loaded Ag+ ions afforded the membrane excellent anti-biofouling activity, which could effectively inhibit the growth of both alga and bacteria in the operating environment, thus preventing membrane blockage during the oil-water separation process. In particular, the bacteriostatic rate of Ag@ZCMF-14 to Escherichia coli reached to 99.6%. These results demonstrate that Ag@ZCMFs with anti-biofouling activity has promising potential future applications in the removal of oil slicks from oily wastewater.","[Wang, Baixian; Wang, Qifei; Di, Jiancheng; Yu, Jihong] Jilin Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Inorgan Synth & Preparat Chem, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jihong] Jilin Univ, Int Ctr Future Sci, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University,"Di, JC; Yu, JH (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Inorgan Synth & Preparat Chem, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.;Yu, JH (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Int Ctr Future Sci, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.",jcdi@jlu.edu.cn; jihong@jlu.edu.cn,"yu, jihong/C-1381-2011",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [21621001, 21835002]; 111 Project, China [B17020]; Jilin Province/Jilin University Co-construction Project-Funds for New Materials, China [SXGJSF2017-3]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project, China(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Jilin Province/Jilin University Co-construction Project-Funds for New Materials, China","The project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21621001, 21835002), the 111 Project, China (B17020) and the Jilin Province/Jilin University Co-construction Project-Funds for New Materials, China (SXGJSF2017-3).",,62,8,9,9,101,PEKING UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"PEKING UNIV, CHEMISTRY BUILDING, BEIJING 100871, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-6818,,,ACTA PHYS-CHIM SIN,Acta Phys.-Chim.

J,"Stack, J",,,,"Stack, John",,,The Mississippi River Basin Compact: A New Governance Structure to Save the Mississippi River,MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WATER; CLAUSE,"The Mississippi River is one of the most significant and yet one of the most imperiled water bodies in the United States. It faces a myriad of problems, from rampant pollution, widespread flooding, wildlife habitat loss, and considerable droughts. Indeed, this is a critical time for the Mississippi River. Fall of 2023 saw River levels drop to extreme lows, with commercial barges grounded and cities deploying emergency measures to protect their municipal water intakes from saltwater intrusion. Meanwhile, polluted Mississippi River water created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico spanning hundreds of square miles, just as it has every summer over the past few decades. Only months prior, record winter precipitation brought major flooding to cities along the upper part of the Mississippi. As demands on the River increase as climate change worsens and the population of the United States grows, these stresses will compound. Droughts will become more consequential, and floods will become more devastating. Impairments to barge traffic will have growing impacts on the economy of the whole United States. Thus, the window of time the country has to put in place preventative measures is slipping and a solution must be implemented quickly. This Note traces the issues facing the Mississippi back to a problem of governance. Existing state and federal initiatives have failed to make a marked dent in many of these problems by failing to work together in a consistent manner. States individually face a collective action problem, lacking the power or the will to effectuate solutions within their borders. The federal government under existing legislation has also been unable to regulate the Mississippi effectively and now has diminished authority to do so after Sackett v. EPA. . In the face of this interstitial power vacuum, this Note proposes a solution that passes legal muster: an interstate compact. Compacts between states are explicitly enshrined in the Constitution, favored by the Supreme Court, and have a track record of success when it comes to regulating water bodies. Specifically, the Great Lakes Water Compact and the Delaware River Basin Compact provide strong models for watershed governance that could well be scaled to the Mississippi River Basin. These compacts draw upon the legal authority of each sovereign signatory, harmonically regulating their respective waterbodies. This Note broadly outlines an interstate compact for the Mississippi River that combines the powers and interests of the states in the Mississippi River basin as well as the federal government, creating an interstate agency that has the legal authority necessary to effectuate proper and timely decisions. While not purporting to provide a silver bullet to the problems faced by the River, this Note argues that such an interstate compact is the best mechanism from which effective solutions can be borne to sustain this great American body of water for future generations.","[Stack, John] Univ Minnesota, Law Sch, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Stack, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Law Sch, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,100,0,0,1,1,MINN LAW REVIEW FOUND,MINNEAPOLIS,"229 19TH AVE SOUTH UNIV MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA",0026-5535,,,MINN LAW REV,Minn.

Everything ages. The aging of living creatures is obvious, but even the very rocks of the earth are aged by the rains of the millennia. This paper deals with aging in electronic systems and emphasizes the identification of system components that may be reaching end-of-life. This paper is the result of years of study of the records of hundreds of installations of electronic control systems in service for some twenty to twenty-five years. This paper is also the result of personal observations on more than twenty Reliability Site Surveys on electronic systems installed in many different areas of the world. As we approach the end of the century and of the millennium, there are many electronic systems nearing the wearout portion of the classical hazard curve. The United States Navy is concerned with the amount of life remaining in the systems in its nuclear submarine fleet. The United States Air Force is similarly concerned with the amount of life remaining in its B52 Bombers. The Air Force has refurbished B52 Bombers by replacing their wings and by upgrading old vacuum tube control systems to state of the art digital electronics.([1]) Similarly, the Federal Aviation Administration has had difficulties with its aging Air Traffic Control, (ATC), system. In 1995, when the ATC computers ... failed at Washington's National Airport, technicians could only find the part in Poland.([2]) The necessary replacement part was an archaic vacuum tube. In the process industries, many electronic control systems are reaching twenty-five years of fruitful service: their silver anniversary. The process industries convert raw materials into finished product. Refineries that crack crude oil into gasoline, mills that convert wood pulp into paper and plants that cook tomatoes into ketchup are excellent examples of the variety of operations in the process industries. In the process industries, electronic control systems are also exhibiting the warning signs of wearout, but incidents at process control plants are not dramatically reported in daily newspapers. Aging and wearout are timely topics for today's economy. Worldwide financial conditions have forced process plant managers to use electronic control systems long beyond their design life. Process industry management has had a reputation for frugality. When capital investments are considered, it is usually easier to make do with existing equipment than to defend the expenditure of capital on new equipment. This fiscal conservatism has presented me with the opportunity to survey electronic control systems in more than 20 process plants, ranging from chemical plants in South Africa, to refineries in Texas and to power plants in Saskatchewan. This paper records the findings of those surveys, adds to the body of literature on aging and wearout in electronics, and makes engineering generalizations that can be applied to similar kinds of systems, such as your personal computer. A review of two decades of the Proceedings of the Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposia found only four papers dealing with the key word, wearout', and none of the four deal with wearout in electronic systems.([3 to 6])","Foxboro Co, Foxboro, MA 02035 USA",,"Rooney, JP (通讯作者)，Foxboro Co, 33 Commercial Ave,N01-3Q, Foxboro, MA 02035 USA.",,,,,,,,12,4,4,0,8,I E E E,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0149-144X,,0-7803-5143-6,P A REL MAI,,,1999,,,,,,,293,299,,10.1109/RAMS.1999.744134,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1999.744134,,,7,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,BM43V,,,,,2025-05-09,WOS:000078742800048,View Full Record in Web of Science

The continued growth of the ageing population has put enormous pressure on the social security and elderly services sectors. The Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has taken a holistic approach, insisting on combining the response to population ageing with the promotion of economic and social development, and promoting the concerted development of the elderly care industry. It is developing a silver-haired economy, developing age-appropriate technologies and products, solving the difficulties of the elderly in using smart technologies, and fostering a new business model for smart ageing. Smart health, smart ageing and smart entertainment are created through the collaboration of intelligent technologies such as big data, cloud computing, internet and internet of things. Through intelligent, digital services, the traditional elderly care model is deepened. It provides an opportunity for the management of health and mind in old age. Entertainment is an essential activity in our lives [1], and it is not only for young people, but should also be used throughout the later years of the elderly. Entertainment products are the direction of choice for older people for leisure, but there are very few products designed for older people in the existing market. The size of the product, the layout of the interface and the guidance system can all have an impact on the use of entertainment products by older people, and if they are not designed properly, there are many hidden dangers that can make older people fearful of the product and the development of modern technology. This not only increases the burden on the elderly themselves, but also on the family's children and society [3, 4]. This study first takes into account the physiological, psychological and cognitive characteristics of the elderly group, and constructs the design of elderly entertainment products under the perspective of perceptual schemability. How to truly make the intelligent entertainment system centred on elderly users and provide humane and friendly products and services through the theory of perceptual schemability is the focus of this study. The project will combine questionnaires, interviews, observations and other user research tools and methods to conduct indepth user research, and carry out user group segmentation, build different types of user role models, and explore the needs of older people for wisdom products and systems in their cognitive environment. In user experience design, perceived schemability is a very important theoretical perspective. When designing products, we should abandon some subjective assumptions and pay full attention to the five dimensions of users' perceived physical performance, perceived cognitive performance, perceived control performance, perceived emotional performance and perceived service performance to build an age-appropriate design framework for smart entertainment in the elderly group. The design of intelligent entertainment is not a single intelligent toy design, but the integration of entertainment behaviour through the synergy of technology, art and technology. It is necessary to classify, summarise, analyse and reorganise information from user research data and the results of stakeholder participation in the design process in a step-by-step manner to complete a theoretical framework for the design of smart entertainment for ageing and its service model from the perspective of perceptual schemability. It will focus on five key areas, the basic design of wisdom entertainment to enhance the awareness of wisdom entertainment among elderly groups; the optimisation of the application platform of wisdom entertainment linked to home to enhance the cognitive ability of elderly users; the expansion of wisdom entertainment user experience and health services to enhance the confidence satisfaction of elderly users; the enrichment of the beneficial and interesting functions of wisdom entertainment to promote the emotional needs of elderly users; and the upgrading of the all-round service of wisdom entertainment linked to home to promote the harmony of information communication between elderly users and society. Finally, combining the Kano model, the needs and quality functions of elderly entertainment products are deconstructed using questionnaire surveymethods, and the needs of elderly entertainment products in terms of form, function, interaction and other functional quality are qualitatively proposed to derive the charming attribute factors of the products. On the basis of the preliminary analysis, model statistics and interaction design models are established, and the results of the data derived from the analysis are applied to practice to propose a system design scheme suitable for the interaction design elements of intelligent entertainment products for the elderly. It is possible to make the entertainment products for the special group of elderly people well represented in the modern and technological era.","[Li, Wenrui] Anhui Univ, Sch Art, Dept Design, Product Design, 111 Jiulong Rd, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China",Anhui University,"Li, WR (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ, Sch Art, Dept Design, Product Design, 111 Jiulong Rd, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.",408434738@qq.com,"Li, Wenrui/JRW-4299-2023",,Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project of Anhui University [K220452029]; Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences in Anhui Universities [K220452029],Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project of Anhui University; Research Project on Humanities and Social Sciences in Anhui Universities,"The authors are very grateful to the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project of Anhui University, project K220452029, for supporting this research, and to those who contributed to this study.

Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness. Objectives How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits? Methods The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events. Main results We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1: 1000), at about 1: 1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments. Authors' conclusions NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.","[Cahill, Kate; Stevens, Sarah; Perera, Rafael; Lancaster, Tim] Univ Oxford, Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",University of Oxford,"Cahill, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Radcliffe Observ Quarter, Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",kate.cahill@phc.ox.ac.uk,,"Lay-Flurrie, Sarah/0000-0003-1094-8455; Perera, Rafael/0000-0003-2418-2091","Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, UK; National School for Health Research School for Primary Care Research, UK; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK","Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, UK; National School for Health Research School for Primary Care Research, UK; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","Internal sources Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, UK.
